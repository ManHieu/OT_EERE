    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>Richer Event Description, Linguistic 
  Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2016T23 and ISBN 1-58563-771-8, was developed by the <a href="http://clear.colorado.edu/start/index.html">University of Colorado Boulder-CLEAR (Computational Language and Education Research</a>, <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> and LDC. It consists of coreference, bridging and event-event relations 
(temporal, causal, subevent and reporting relations) annotations over 95 
English newswire, discussion forum and narrative text documents, covering all events, 
times and non-eventive entities within each document. </p>
<p>RED annotation is intended to join different annotation layers and to provide  a rich representation of event 
  phenomena.</p>
  
  <h3>Data</h3>
<p> Documents were annotated twice -- in a markable pass 
and in an event annotation phase. In the markable pass, events, entities, TIMEX3 and section elements were annotated across the entire document and features were marked on each markable element. Event relations and event 
coreference were then annotated over the adjudicated markables. Further information about the annotation process is contained in the guidelines accompanying this release.</p>
<p> Annotation and source documents are divided into three partitions: (1) 20  newswire summarization documents, (2) 20  discussion 
  forum documents and newswire annotations used in the original RED pilot annotations, and (3) 55 documents 
  annotated by a range of DEFT (Deep Exploration and Filtering of Test) annotation formats. Data is presented as UTF-8 encoded xml and plain text.</p>
