Ghost haunts pardon process

ALBANY, N.Y. – While Christmas marks a traditional time during which governors commute the sentences of a handful of prisoners, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has granted none since taking office in 2011.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, Cuomo has given no commutations, in which prisoners are released; or pardons, in which convictions are nullified.
</P>
<P>
That’s in contrast with the previous four governors, including Cuomo’s father, Mario M. Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
The elder Cuomo, Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson all granted clemency during their terms as governor.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Cuomo hasn’t closed the door on the idea, but he’s made no promises. When asked if any clemency was forthcoming this year, spokesman Richard Azzopardi said that ''all requests are reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
There doesn’t appear to be a public outcry over clemencies, and a governor can grant them at any time.
</P>
<P>
But reform activists have taken note of the lack of action. ''Every year, I ask him to use his power of executive clemency. He has not used any yet,'' said Anthony Papa, spokesman for the Drug Policy Alliance, which pushes to reform drug laws.
</P>
<P>
''Historically, other governors have done this around Christmas,'' added John O’Hara, a Brooklyn lawyer who was convicted of voter fraud in a convoluted case involving a battle he had with the borough’s Democratic machine. He has since regained his ability to practice law, but continues to seek a pardon for his felony conviction.
</P>
<P>
Papa, who was serving time on a drug conviction and was granted a commutation by former Gov. George Pataki, said he believes Cuomo, like some other politicians, has been influenced by the ''Willie Horton Syndrome,'' which dates to the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Horton was serving a life term for murder in Massachusetts when he left prison under a furlough and committed an armed robbery and rape.
</P>
<P>
Michael Dukakis was governor of Massachusetts at the time and George H.W. Bush’s campaign exploited the Horton incident to make Dukakis, a Democrat, look soft on crime during the 1988 presidential race. Bush, a Republican, won.
</P>
<P>
Papa believes Cuomo worries that if a commutation were to turn out badly, it could come back to haunt him, possibly in a presidential contest down the road.
</P>
<P>
''The Democrats have been scared,'' agreed Jim Murphy, a former jail chaplain and Capital Region prison-reform activist. ''They are more vulnerable to the tough-on-crime talk.''
</P>
<P>
Cuomo’s Democratic predecessors, though, have given commutations and pardons.
</P>
<P>
David Paterson granted three commutations and 35 pardons; Eliot Spitzer granted one pardon.
</P>
<P>
Republican Gov. George Pataki gave 32 commutations, largely for Rockefeller Drug Law cases, and one posthumous pardon to comedian Lenny Bruce.
</P>
<P>
Democrat Mario Cuomo gave 37 commutations and Hugh Carey, who served through 1982 (pre-Willie Horton) gave 155 commutations and pardons.
