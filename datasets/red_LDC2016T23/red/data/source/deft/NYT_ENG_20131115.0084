PRISON SENTENCE FOR MANHATTAN FORTUNETELLER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW YORK - Sylvia Mitchell, the Manhattan fortuneteller whose ornate Greenwich Village parlor and air of uptown sophistication attracted well-to-do, distraught clients who preferred the finer things in life, was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison on Thursday, a month after a jury convicted her of grand larceny.

<P>
In handing down the sentence, Justice Gregory Carro of state Supreme Court acknowledged that the penalty was harsher than that requested by prosecutors at Thursday’s hearing. The Manhattan district attorney’s office had requested a sentence of three to nine years in prison.

“You had a perfect setup,” Carro said. “We have lots of con artists here in New York City,” he said, citing three-card monte dealers and those who pretend their glasses were just broken by a stranger who bumped into them on the street.

But Mitchell lured “someone who is having some dramatic stress in their life, some great problems they were going through, looking for some kind of help,” the judge said.

Mitchell, 39, began to weep upon entering the courtroom, handcuffed and somewhat haggard after a month in jail on Rikers Island and glimpsing a row of mostly elderly men, presumably relatives, who were sitting with the father of her two teenage children.

She told the judge she was sorry for what she had done. “I want to go back to school and start a new profession and start my life again,” she said.
</P>
<P>
She was ordered to pay more than $110,000 in restitution to the two victims in the case, something her lawyer, Kenneth Gribetz, said he came prepared to do with a check from an escrow account. He said he planned to appeal the sentence, which he said was overly harsh given that prosecutors, long before trial, had offered her a plea deal involving no jail time. She refused the offer.

Both victims, Lee Choong and Debra Saalfield, wrote letters describing the pain caused by their dealings with Mitchell. Both had approached her during periods of romantic upheaval in their lives. Both testified against Mitchell, and in doing so, admitted that in hindsight, all her talk of curses and evil spirits seemed far-fetched, but at the time, unsettling. Choong said she was drawn to the parlor, called Zena on Seventh Avenue South, because it was plush and relatively pricey.

Saalfield said that the news media coverage of the case had further hurt her. At a recent wedding rehearsal dinner that she attended, she wrote, “one of the guests stared at me at great length and put an 'L’ for loser on her face while looking at me.”
