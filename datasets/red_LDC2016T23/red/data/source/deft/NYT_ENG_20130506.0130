DEATH ROW INMATE ’ S REQUEST FOR DNA TESTING IS REJECTED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state of Mississippi rejected on Monday a request to submit physical evidence for DNA testing made by a prisoner scheduled to be put to death Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Willie J. Manning, convicted in 1994 of murdering two college students, had been repeatedly rebuffed in the courts as he sought to have DNA tests performed on certain crime scene evidence. But the most recent requests came about because of two letters sent by the Justice Department in recent days to the prosecutor who handled Manning’s trial.
</P>
<P>
The letters concerned the trial testimony of an FBI expert asked to examine “hair fragments” found at the scene of the murders. The expert testified that in this case he could determine only that the hairs came from an African-American but that hair comparison analysis was capable, given better samples, of matching a hair to a particular individual.
</P>
<P>
Manning is black; the murder victims were white. The prosecutor cited this testimony several times in his closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated May 2, the Justice Department said the expert’s testimony about the general capability of hair analysis – that it could match a hair to a specific individual – was erroneous and “exceeded the limits of the science.” Then, in a letter dated May 4, the department further said that such analysis could not “determine” that a hair came from a person of a certain race, as the expert testified at one point, only that the hair “possesses certain traits that are associated with a particular racial group.”
</P>
<P>
The FBI offered in both letters to perform DNA testing on the hair fragments.
</P>
<P>
Manning’s lawyers argued that these letters constituted new evidence and thus that the hairs, as well as other evidence collected at the scene including a rape kit and fingernail scrapings, should be submitted for DNA testing before Manning is put to death.
</P>
<P>
In the response denying the requests, the state attorney general, Jim Hood, called the new requests a “red herring,” saying that the letters did not “represent new evidence,” nor did they repudiate the testimony given by the FBI expert in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Manning’s lawyers are still lobbying the governor for a stay of execution. On Friday, Manning’s brother and the Mississippi Innocence Project filed suit to preserve all the physical evidence for DNA testing even if the execution is carried out.
