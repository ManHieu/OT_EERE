Dewhurst wants to bill feds for undocumented prisoners

AUSTIN, Texas -- Days after calling for the impeachment of President Barack Obama, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst is demanding that the president pay for the 130,000 undocumented immigrants who are housed in county jails across Texas -- a tab that could run nearly $157 million in the past two years alone.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Obama, Dewhurst said the federal government should reimburse Texas counties for the cost of housing the undocumented immigrants because the feds have failed to secure the U.S. Mexico border as they should have.

<P>
''It’s time we ask for that money back,'' Dewhurst said in an email to supporters this week, asking them to sign a petition supporting his position. ''It’s outrageous that county jails pay for housing to more than 130,000 people that illegally enter our state.
</P>
<P>
''In my experience, I believe the immigration conversation begins and ends with strict border security, as our counties can no longer fund this massive financial burden.''
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Obama, Dewhurst wrote: ''The dollars expended in this fashion would be better spent enhancing law enforcement efforts to better protect our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
No word yet from Washington on what they think of Dewhurst’s demand, but don’t expect a check to be arriving anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
Dewhurst, who has drawn three GOP challengers in his re-election bid, has made a sharp turn to the right in his political rhetoric since losing a U.S. Senate runoff to tea party star Ted Cruz in July 2012. Two weeks ago, Dewhurst publicly advocated Obama’s impeachment at a tea party forum in Fort Worth -- a move that drew surprise since it came from Texas’ No. 2 officeholder.
</P>
<P>
State and county officials have complained for years that detained immigrants are costing local taxpayers, and federal officials have declined to reimburse any costs because the jailed suspects are being held on local charges.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, state officials have also complained that state prisons are holding thousands of undocumented immigrants who were convicted of state crimes. At one point last year, well over 12,000 state convicts had deportation detainers on them -- meaning that as soon as they complete their sentence or are paroled they are subject to being deported, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Most are Mexican citizens, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
Proposals to deport convicts serving time for nonviolent crimes before they were paroled have failed to gain support from legislative leaders, who feared if they were paroled and returned home they would simply slip back across the border into Texas.
</P>
<P>
The savings from that plan were estimated to be at least $15 million, officials said at the time.  	Mike Ward writes for the Austin American-Statesman. E-mail: mward(at)statesman.com.
