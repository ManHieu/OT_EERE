SUMMARY: OSCE URGES PERMANENT END TO AFGHAN TERRORISM AND DRUG-TRAFFICKING TO CREATE LONG-TERM STABILITY IN CENTRAL ASIA. EXPERT STATES THAT CULTIVATION OF OPIUM AND DRUG TRAFFICKING ARE DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN AFGHANISTAN AND WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ERADICATE. 
BODY: 1. ON 10 FEBRUARY 2002 AN OFFICIAL WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE WAS QUOTED AS STATING THAT LONG-TERM STABILITY IN CENTRAL ASIA DEPENDS ON ERADICATING POST-TALIBAN AFGHAN TERRORISM AND DRUG-TRAFFICKING.
2. THE OSCE ENVOY IN NEIGHBORING TAJIKISTAN MARC GILBERT STATED TO THE GOVERNMENT WEEKLY NATIONAL GAZETTE THAT THERE ARE NOW HOPES THAT AFGHANISTAN WILL DEVELOP ITS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND END TERRORISM AND DRUG-SMUGGLING RESULTING IN GREATER STABILITY IN CENTRAL ASIA.
3. GILBERT STATED THAT THE POST-SOVIET REPUBLICS IN CENTRAL ASIA FOUGHT TERRORISM BY GIVING MATERIAL AND OTHER NECESSARY HELP TO THE INTERNATIONAL ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION IN THE WAR AGAINST SAUDI DISSIDENT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN REGIME.
4. BOTH TAJIKISTAN AND UZBEKISTAN SHARE A BORDER WITH AFGHANISTAN AND HAVE EXPERIENCED RAIDS BY TALIBAN-BACKED ISLAMIC MILITANTS IN RECENT YEARS.
A. NEIGHBORING KYRGYZSTAN HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED RAIDS BY TALIBAN-BACKED ISLAMIC MILITANTS IN RECENT YEARS.
5. KAZAKHSTAN ALSO BECAME A KEY U.S. PARTNER IN THE AFGHAN WAR OPENING ITS AIRSPACE TO MILITARY OVERFLIGHTS. 
6. TURKMENISTAN MAINTAINED A MORE NEUTRAL STANCE. TURKMENISTAN BORDERS AFGHANISTAN.
7. GILBERT STATED THAT TAJIKISTAN'S POSITIVE AND RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO THE CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE COUNTRY'S IMAGE INTERNATIONALLY.
8. TAJIK GOVERNMENT EXPERT AND HEAD OF THE TAJIK DRUG CONTROL AGENCY VLADIMIR RAKHMONOV STATED ON 10 FEBRUARY 2002 THAT THE U.S.-LED WAR IN AFGHANISTAN HAD FAILED TO STOP DRUG TRAFFICKING ACROSS THE BORDER INTO TAJIKISTAN.
9. RAKHMONOV STATED TO INTERFAX--
A. OPIUM AND HEROIN ARE A FORM OF HARD-CURRENCY RESERVE FOR AFGHANISTAN.
B. DRUG TRAFFICKING FROM AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN CONCEALED SO SECURELY THAT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNCOVER.
C. DRUG TRAFFICKING FROM AFGHANISTAN RESUMED DURING A BRIEF HIATUS IN THE ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATION.
D. IN 2001 TAJIK LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND RUSSIAN BORDER GUARDS SEIZED 8.8 TONS OF DRUGS INCLUDING 4.2 TONS OF HEROIN. THIS REPRESENTED A 26 PERCENT INCREASE OVERALL IN 2001 WITH 3 TIMES THE AMOUNT OF HEROIN.
E. SUGGESTIONS THAT THERE ARE NO LONGER DRUG LORDS IN AFGHANISTAN AND THAT DRUG TRAFFIC INTO TAJIKISTAN HAS BEEN ERADICATED ARE UNREALISTIC AND FALSE.
F. MANY YEARS WOULD BE NEEDED TO CONVERT AFGHANISTAN'S AGRICULTURE HISTORICALLY SPECIALIZED IN THE GROWING OF RAW OPIUM. CULTIVATION OF RAW OPIUM PROVIDED THE ONLY SOURCE OF INCOME FOR MUCH OF THE RURAL POPULATION.
10. TAJIKISTAN'S 780-MILE BORDER WITH AFGHANISTAN IS PATROLLED BY APPROXIMATELY 11000 RUSSIAN SOLDIERS UNDER A 1992 AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN AND TAJIK GOVERNMENTS.
