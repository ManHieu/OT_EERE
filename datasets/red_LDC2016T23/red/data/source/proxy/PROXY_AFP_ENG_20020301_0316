A. QANOONI TOLD RUSSIAN DEPUTY MINISTER FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS YURY VOROBYOV-- 
UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS, THE RULE OF THE TALIBAN TURNED AFGHANISTAN INTO A CENTER OF TERRORISM AND DRUGS.
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM AND AGAINST DRUGS, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SECURITY IS A PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF AFGHANISTAN. BUT COMBATING TERRORISM AND DRUGS REQUIRES JOINT EFFORTS.
PEACE AND STABILITY IN AFGHANISTAN IS NOT ONLY IN THE INTERESTS OF THE AFGHANI PEOPLE AND NATION BUT OF ALL THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION.
