BODY: 1. A NEW SOUTH WALES SUPREME COURT JURY TOOK JUST OVER 2 HOURS ON 020201 TO FIND GAFUR RAKHIMOV HAD BEEN LIBELLED IN A BOOK THE GREAT OLYMPIC SWINDLE WHICH ALLEGES OLYMPIC CORRUPTION. GAFUR RAKHIMOV IS AN UZBEKISTAN OLYMPIC BOXING OFFICIAL AND WAS DEPICTED IN THE BOOK AS A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL HEROIN DEALER AND RACKETEER. THE GREAT OLYMPIC SWINDLE WAS WRITTEN BY BRITISH JOURNALIST ANDREW JENNINGS AND PUBLISHED BY SIMON AND SCHUSTER. THE RAKHIMOV CASE WILL NOW GO TO A SINGLE JUDGE TO HEAR DEFENCES AND DECIDE ANY DAMAGES TO BE AWARDED TO RAKHIMOV. 
2. THE GREAT OLYMPIC SWINDLE IMPLIED THAT GAFUR RAKHIMOV HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN FRAUD, PROSTITUTION, ASSASSINATION, GUN RUNNING AND PLUTONIUM SMUGGLING. THE BOOK ALSO IMPLIED THAT THE BUSINESSMAN WAS A GANGSTER IN THE SOVIET BLACK ECONOMY AND HAD TRADED SPORTING MEDALS FOR BRIBES. RAKHIMOV WAS VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE OLYMPIC COUNCIL OF ASIA AND AN EXECUTIVE MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL AMATEUR BOXING ASSOCIATION. RAKHIMOV WAS ALSO SAID TO HAVE BRIBED MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL AMATEUR BOXING FEDERATION IN THE VOTE FOR THE FEDERATION PRESIDENCY. JENNINGS IS A LONG-TIME CRITIC OF THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE.
3. THE 020201 VERDICT FOLLOWED 2 DEFAMATION ACTIONS BROUGHT LAST YEAR BY RAKHIMOV AGAINST THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION (ABC) AND JENNINGS AND AGAINST THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD (SMH) AND JENNINGS. A JURY FOUND IN THE CASE INVOLVING THE ABC THAT ABC'S FLAGSHIP CURRENT AFFAIRS PROGRAM FOUR CORNERS HAD IMPLIED RAKHIMOV KNEW SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS CRIMINALS AND WAS SUSPECTED BY THE FBI OF DRUG TRAFFICKING. THAT PANEL FOUND THOSE INSINUATIONS WERE NOT DEFAMATORY AND THREW OUT THE CASE AGAINST THE ABC AND JENNINGS. THE SMH AND JENNINGS WERE THEN SUED OVER 3 ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE 000000 OLYMPICS. THE JURY IN THAT CASE FOUND RAKHIMOV HAD BEEN PAINTED AS A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL AND HAD BEEN DEFAMED.
