SUMMARY: THE NUMBER OF HEROIN ADDICTS IN TAJIKISTAN HAS VASTLY INCREASED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS DUE TO DRUG TRAFFICKING BETWEEN AFGHANISTAN AND RUSSIA AND EUROPE.
BODY: 1. THE NUMBER OF HEROIN ADDICTS IN TAJIKISTAN HAS VASTLY INCREASED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS DUE TO DRUG TRAFFICKING BETWEEN AFGHANISTAN AND EUROPE.
A. THE MAJORITY OF THE HEROIN IS GROWN IN NEIGHBORING AFGHANISTAN. AFGHANISTAN IS THE WORLD'S TOP OPIUM PRODUCER. 
B. TAJIKISTAN SHARES A 1300-KILOMETER (800-MILE) BORDER WITH AFGHANISTAN AND HAS BECOME A TRANSIT POINT FOR HEROIN BEING TRAFFICKED INTO RUSSIA AND EUROPE. 
C. IN 2001 THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND TAJIK POLICE CONFISCATED NEARLY 9 TONS OF DRUGS AND ARRESTED MORE THAN 2000 PEOPLE. THE RUSSIAN ARMY GUARDS TAJIKISTAN'S BORDER WITH AFGHANISTAN. 
2. THE MAJORITY OF TAJIKISTAN'S HEROIN ADDICTS LIVE IN CITIES AND ARE AGED BETWEEN 18 AND 25. 75 PERCENT OF TAJIKISTAN'S POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS, WHERE HEROIN ADDICTS ARE FREQUENTLY OSTRACIZED. 
3. HEAD OF A PUBLIC DRUG CLINIC IN DUSHANBE, TAJIKISTAN ANDREI ONISHCHENKO, STATED--
THERE ARE 5000 HEROIN ADDICTS OFFICIALLY REGISTERED IN TAJIKISTAN, COMPARED WITH 57 IN 1997.
THE ACTUAL FIGURE IS SEVEN TIMES GREATER THAN THE OFFICIAL NUMBER.
THE LOW COST AND AVAILABILITY OF HEROIN ARE AMONG THE CAUSES OF THE ADDICTION PROBLEM. ONE DOSE OF HEROIN COSTS LESS THAN A DOLLAR IN TAJIKISTAN, WHICH IS LESS THAN THE PRICE OF A BOTTLE OF THE LOCAL VODKA.
AN ADDICT WHO HAS BEEN USING HEROIN FOR 2 YEARS NEEDS TO USE 3 GRAMS OF HEROIN EVERY 24 HOURS. 3 GRAMS OF HEROIN COSTS 70 SOMONIS OR 30 DOLLARS. 
AN ADDICT IS WILLING TO COMMIT ANY CRIME TO PAY FOR HEROIN. 
AFGHAN HEROIN IS THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD BECAUSE IT IS MADE FROM POPPIES CULTIVATED AT HIGH ALTITUDES AND THEREFORE SUBJECTED TO HIGH DOSES OF ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT.
A PERSON WHO TAKES A DAILY DOSE OF AFGHAN HEROIN HAS A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF BETWEEN 5 AND 7 YEARS AND MANY COMMIT SUICIDE BEFORE THAT.
4. THE TAJIK STATE PAYS 25 DIRAMS (A FEW CENTS) PER DAY FOR EVERY PERSON IN THE REHABILITATION CLINICS. THE PERCENTAGE OF RELAPSES IS VERY HIGH DUE TO THE LACK OF FOLLOWUP TREATMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE.
5. HEAD OF A TAJIK GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT FIGHTS DRUG TRAFFICKING  AVAZ YULDACHEV STATED THAT HEROIN USERS ARE ILL AND NEED TREATMENT.
6. ANVAR, A 14-YEAR-OLD BOY FROM DUSHANBE, USED HEROIN FOR THREE YEARS BEFORE BEING HOSPITALIZED IN ONISHCHENKO'S DRUG CLINIC. ANVAR SAID--
HE SNIFFED A WHITE SUBSTANCE HE FOUND IN HIS BACKYARD AND WAS UNABLE TO STOP. 
HE STOPPED GOING TO SCHOOL.
HE STOLE FROM THE LOCAL MARKET TO GET MONEY FOR MORE HEROIN.
7. DRUG TRAFFICKERS FACE THE DEATH PENALTY UNDER TAJIK LAW.
8. TAJIKISTAN HAS 6.2 MILLION INHABITANTS.
