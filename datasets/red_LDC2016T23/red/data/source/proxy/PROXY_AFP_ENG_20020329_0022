SUMMARY: A SENIOR SOUTH KOREAN MINISTER ON FRIDAY WARNED THAT THERE COULD BE A NEW CRISIS THIS YEAR OVER INSPECTIONS OF THE RIVAL NORTH'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
BODY: 1. SENIOR SOUTH KOREAN MINISTER JEONG SE-HYUN ON 020329 WARNED THAT TENSIONS COULD RISE BECAUSE NORTH KOREA WANTS INSPECTIONS OF ITS NUCLEAR FACILITIES DELAYED. UNIFICATION MINISTER JEONG IS THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF POLICYMAKER FOR RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. JEONG SAID IN A LECTURE ON SOUTH KOREA AND US RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA THAT THERE WAS SOME TALK IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE NUCLEAR INSPECTION IN NORTH KOREA SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN 020800. NORTH KOREA'S SUGGESTION IS THAT THE INSPECTION SHOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL 050000. JEONG SAID THAT A CRISIS COULD COME IN 020800 ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA IF THIS ISSUE BECOMES AN INTERNATIONAL POINT OF CONTENTION.
2. FOLLOWING JEONG'S COMMENTS ANOTHER SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SOUGHT TO PLAY DOWN JEONG'S REMARKS ABOUT THE LOOMING TROUBLES. THE UNNAMED OFFICIAL TOLD THE YONHAP NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY THAT TALK OF PRESSING FOR IAEA INSPECTIONS IN 020800 HAD COME ONLY FROM PRIVATE RESEARCHERS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE OFFICIAL SAID IT WAS SPECULATION THAT THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT THINKS THE INSPECTIONS SHOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL 050000.
3. TOP SOUTH KOREAN ENVOY LIM WON-DONG INTENDS TO RAISE INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE NORTH'S NUCLEAR AND MISSILE PROGRAMS WHEN HE GOES TO PYONGYANG 020403. LIM IS A SPECIAL ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT KIM DAE-JUNG ON NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS. LIM HAS ALSO WARNED OF A LOOMING NUCLEAR CRISIS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. MILITARY OFFICIALS SAID LIM INTIMATED THE PROBLEMS COULD BE AS SERIOUS AS A 940000 NUCLEAR STANDOFF OVER NORTH KOREA'S SUSPECTED NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT THAT CAME CLOSE TO CONFLICT.
4. THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO FREEZE THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM UNDER AN ACCORD WITH A US-LED INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM. THE CONSORTIUM IS TO BUILD 2 LIGHT WATER NUCLEAR REACTORS THAT PRODUCE LESS WEAPONS GRADE FUEL THAN NORTH KOREA'S OLD GRAPHITE REACTORS AND PROVIDE SUBSTITUTE FUEL UNTIL THEY ARE BUILT. THE ORIGINAL 030000 TARGET DATE FOR COMPLETION HAS BEEN PUT BACK AT LEAST 5 YEARS BECAUSE OF MAJOR POLITICAL AND CONSTRUCTION DELAYS. THE 940000 ACCORD STIPULATED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA) MUST BE ALLOWED TO INSPECT NORTH KOREA'S OLD FACILITIES TO SEE IF PLUTONIUM HAS BEEN PROCESSED BEFORE THE CORE FACILITIES OF THE NEW REACTORS ARE INSTALLED.
