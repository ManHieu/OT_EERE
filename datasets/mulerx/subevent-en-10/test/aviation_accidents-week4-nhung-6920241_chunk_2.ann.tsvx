Text	It was later discovered that the non-revenue pilot who activated the emergency exit slide had not been adequately trained in its operation .	The handle that was pulled released the slide so it could be used as a raft in the event of a water landing , and the slide subsequently detached from the airplane .	The NTSB conducted a full investigation of the accident .	It found that although the aircraft had encountered a crosswind during landing , the conditions were well within the safe capabilities of the aircraft .	The first officer did not properly line up the plane before touchdown , nor did she slow the plane adequately before touchdown , so that the plane landed excessively hard .
