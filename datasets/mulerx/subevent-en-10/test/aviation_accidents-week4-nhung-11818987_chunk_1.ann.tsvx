Text	The winds were calm .	The Coast Guard and other searchers sighted the wreckage around dawn in Lake Pontchartrain , about northeast of New Orleans .	The subsequent investigation concluded that the jet crashed into Lake Pontchartrain en route due to " degradation of aircraft stability characteristics in turbulence , because of abnormal longitudinal trim component positions . "	The water was only deep , yet only 60 percent of the wreckage was recovered because the breakup was so extensive .	The flight data recorder tape was too damaged to help the investigation .
