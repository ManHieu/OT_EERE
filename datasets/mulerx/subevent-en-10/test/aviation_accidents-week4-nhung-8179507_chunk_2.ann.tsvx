Text	After a normal takeoff , the flight was assigned a cruise altitude of flight level 250 ( FL250 ) , then reassigned to FL240 .	At 09:54 , the flight crew responded to the Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center and started descending to 9,000 feet .	At approximately 10:03 while descending through 11,500 feet with an indicated airspeed of 260 knots , the leading edge of the left horizontal stabilizer separated from the airframe , and the airplane pitched down dramatically , rolling around on an axis as the left wing folded .	The escaping fuel from the wings ignited , and the pilot s lost consciousness from the severe g - forces , which reached at least 3.375 times the force of gravity , caused by the severe oscillations of the crippled aircraft .	The wreckage fell in southeast Colorado County , Texas , exploding on impact , off Farm to Market Road 102 , southeast of Eagle Lake , Texas , and west of Downtown Houston .
