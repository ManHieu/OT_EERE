Text	This was quickly fixed , but press reporters insisting on last - minute interviews further delayed take - off and the _ Aotearoa _ did not become airborne until 02:44 ( 05:14 New Zealand time ) , immediately turning on course for New Zealand .	The take - off on the Tasman flight was only the aircraft 's fifth since being reassembled after delivery .	Thirty - two minutes later , at 05:46 NZ time , the officer of the watch on the trans - Tasman steamer _ Maunganui _ , 12 miles east of Sydney Heads , heard " the soft regular whirr " of an aircraft engine passing overhead , although he did not see the aircraft itself .	The timing and the position of the steamer indicated an aircraft ground speed of 90 mph / 145 km / h , about right for the intended flight .	For simplicity , Moncrieff and Hood had planned to fly a rhumb line course , intending to make landfall at Farewell Spit at the western entrance to Cook Strait .
