Text	It was followed by the Super Puma , which approached the landing zone at a steep angle and hovered back and forth above the ground for about 30 seconds , raising ever more snow that fully engulfed the first helicopter .	During this manoeuvre , the third helicopter , also a Super Puma , approached the landing zone , carrying the pilot , an engineer , and 13 officers .	This third aircraft also raised a large cloud of snow from the ground while landing , causing the pilot to lose sight of the marshalling officer on the ground .	The third helicopter then touched the ground which caused the aircraft to roll over .	Thereby its main rotor and tail section collided with the EC155 's main rotor .
