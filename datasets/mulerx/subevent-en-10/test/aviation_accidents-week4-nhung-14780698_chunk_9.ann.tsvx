Text	However , the two returned home in July 1984 and it turned out that a major sponsor of Africa Sports had pulled out so this changed the fortunes of the club and they decided to return to Zambia .	The duo arrived just in time to lend a hand to Dynamos final push for the league championship .	Chola missed a penalty when Dynamos suffered their only league loss in October 1984 , a 2- 0 defeat to eventual runners - up Mufulira Wanderers but Dynamos avenged this a week later when they whipped Wanderers 4 - 1 in the reverse fixture at Arthur Davies Stadium .	This helped Dynamos to the title for the first time in their history .	Dynamos were not finished as they crushed Kabwe Warriors 4 - 2 in the semi-final of the Champion of Champions with Chola grabbing a hat - trick , and when they met Wanderers in the final , Dynamos prevailed 2 - 0 .
