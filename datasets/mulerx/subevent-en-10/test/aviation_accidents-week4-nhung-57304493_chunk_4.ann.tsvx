Text	The investigation carried out by the USAF found the root cause of the crash to be pilot s error following an engine malfunction .	During the takeoff roll , engine number 1 ( the left outboard engine ) experienced performance fluctuations which went unnoticed until after takeoff .	The engine power dropped from nearly to under 300 , causing the aircraft to pull to the left , nearly departing the runway .	The investigation found that the takeoff should have been aborted but was not .	Furthermore , the investigation determined that the flight crew had failed to adequately prepare for emergency actions , and the maintenance technicians failed to properly diagnose and repair the malfunctioning engine before flight .
