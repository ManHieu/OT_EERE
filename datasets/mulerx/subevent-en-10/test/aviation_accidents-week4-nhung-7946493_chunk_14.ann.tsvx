Text	Further investigation by the NTSB revealed a design flaw in the ejector seat and canopy assemblies of the fighter plane whereby the pilot would probably not be able to eject if the radar intercept officer ejected first .	Since the specific design of ejector seats installed in the F - 4 B were not intended to be fired through the aircraft 's canopy , a circuit breaker kept the seat from ejecting if the canopy was in place .	Once the canopy was manually unlocked , the ejector seat circuit was completed and could be fired .	This specific design of ejector seat , however , had a tendency of being unable to complete the circuit in the pilot 's ejector seat if the aft ejector seat was fired first .	The F - 4 B aircraft were in the process of being modified with a newly designed canopy when the collision occurred .
