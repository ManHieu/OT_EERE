Text	The team 's report was critical of the Mission Management Team for asserting that there were no safety concerns before the Debris Assessment Team 's investigation had been completed .	Throughout the risk assessment process , senior NASA managers were influenced by their belief that nothing could be done even if damage were detected .	This affected their stance on investigation urgency , thoroughness and possible contingency actions .	They decided to conduct a parametric " what - if " scenario study more suited to determine risk probabilities of future events , instead of inspecting and assessing the actual damage .	The investigation report in particular singled out NASA manager Linda Ham for exhibiting this attitude .
