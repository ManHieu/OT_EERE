Text	A review of data from the airplane 's quick access recorder revealed that the pilots had neglected to perform complete flight control checks before 98 percent of their previous 175 takeoffs in the airplane , indicating that this oversight was habitual and not an exceptional event .	The gust lock handle also included an interlock mechanism intended to limit the throttle levers to just enough power for taxiing and idle while engaged .	According to Gulfstream , this had been intended to prevent pilots from attempting to take off with the gust lock engaged .	However , post-accident testing on other Gulfstream - IV airplanes found that , with the gust lock handle in the ON position , the forward throttle lever movement that could be achieved was three to four times greater than intended .	The NTSB concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the flight crew 's failure to perform the flight control check before takeoff , which led to their attempt to take off with the gust lock system engaged , and their delay in aborting the takeoff after they became aware that the controls were locked .
