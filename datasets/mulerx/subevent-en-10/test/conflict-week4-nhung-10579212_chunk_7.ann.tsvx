Text	It was led by the South Saskatchewan Regiment , with supporting units from the Queen 's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada .	In the early hours of 20 July , the Camerons secured a position in Saint - André - sur - Orne but were quickly pinned down by German infantry and tanks .	At the same time , the South Saskatchewan Regiment moved directly up the slopes of Verrières Ridge , supported by tanks and Hawker Typhoon ground attack aircraft .	The Canadian attack faltered in torrential rain , which rendered air support useless and turned the ground into mud .	Counter-attacks by two divisions threw the South Saskatchewans back past their support lines and their supporting battalion — the Essex Scottish — came under attack .
