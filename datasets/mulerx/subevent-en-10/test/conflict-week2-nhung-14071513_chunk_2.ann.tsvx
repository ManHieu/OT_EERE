Text	He sent word to the waiting Swedish force begging them to retreat upon meeting , but Mardefelt , having been unaware of the treaty , interpreted the plea as a trick of battle .	As a result of poor communication , and to Augustus ' dismay , the Battle of Kalisz did occur .	At the time , king Augustus of Poland , also the Electorate of Saxony , had in secret negotiated a peace treaty with the swedes .	This because after five years of marching , war and burning , the swedes had attacked Augustus where it hurt ; his own electorate .	Thus , the main Swedish army was at the time in Saxony .
