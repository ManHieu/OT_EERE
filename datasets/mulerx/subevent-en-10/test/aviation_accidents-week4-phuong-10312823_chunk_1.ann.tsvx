Text	He began his career as a camera assistant at Gaumont British Studios at Shepherd 's Bush .	He developed a very close relationship with Balcon which lasted for the rest of his life ; Balcon 's children both later commented that their father " regarded him as a son " .	At Gaumont , he was assigned to assist Hitchcock on his original version of _ The Man Who Knew Too Much _ ( 1934 ) , on which he met his future wife .	He also assisted Hitchcock on _ The 39 Steps _ ( 1935 ) with Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll ; during filming , Hitchcock reportedly humiliated Tennyson by pretending that Carroll had refused to be carried across the Scottish marsh set by Donat , and he forced Tennyson to don Carroll 's wig and costume and double for her in the scene .	Tennyson followed Balcon when he was appointed head of production at the former Associated Talking Pictures , newly renamed as Ealing Studios .
