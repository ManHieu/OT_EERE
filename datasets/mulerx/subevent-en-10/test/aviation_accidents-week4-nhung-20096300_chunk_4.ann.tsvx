Text	The wreckage was taken back to RAF Binbrook for investigation .	Normally this would have happened at the MOD Crash Investigation Branch , part of the Royal Aircraft Establishment ( now the Air Accidents Investigation Branch ) at Farnborough .	In a letter to the aviation magazine _ FlyPast _ a retired RAF Sqn Ldr states that his aircraft ( Avro Shackleton Mk. III WR 981 ) was the ' Object ' tracked by the various radar stations , and the incident was part of a much larger TACEVAL ( station TACtical EVALuation ) exercise .	Two Lightnings were involved .	The first made four approaches on the Shackleton , before departing the area while the second started an approach ( flown by Capt Schaffner ) , before breaking off to Starboard .
