Text	Immediately after the events , 91 revolutionaries were sentenced to exile .	Of these , a small group was transported by barges from Giurgiu , on their way to the Austrian - ruled Svinița , near the Danube port of Orschowa .	The revolutionary artist Constantin Daniel Rosenthal and Maria Rosetti , both of whom had been allowed to go free and had subsequently followed the barges on shore , pointed out that the Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction , and were able to persuade the mayor of Svinița to disarm the guards , which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee .	The escapees then made their way to Paris .	Most other revolutionaries were detained in areas of present - day Bulgaria until spring 1849 , and , passing through Rustchuk and Varna , were taken to the Anatolian city of Brusa , where they lived at the expense of the Ottoman state .
