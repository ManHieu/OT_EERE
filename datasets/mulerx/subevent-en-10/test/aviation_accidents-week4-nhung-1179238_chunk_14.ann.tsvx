Text	Beauchamp - Proctor was killed on 21 June 1921 in a training accident flying a Sopwith Snipe , in preparation for an air show at the RAF Hendon .	His aircraft went into a vicious spin after performing a slow loop , and he was killed in the ensuing crash .	At least one observer remarked that the loss of control and subsequent crash of the aircraft could have been linked to Proctor 's diminutive size .	He was originally buried at Upavon , Wiltshire , but in August 1921 his body was returned to South Africa where he was given a state funeral .	There still exists confusion over Beauchamp - Proctor 's given name .
