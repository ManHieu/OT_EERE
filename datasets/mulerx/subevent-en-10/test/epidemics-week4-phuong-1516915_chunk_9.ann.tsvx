Text	The direct transfer of the virus probably occurs either by pigs touching noses , or through dried mucus .	Airborne transmission through the aerosols produced by pigs coughing or sneezing are also an important means of infection .	The virus usually spreads quickly through a herd , infecting all the pigs within just a few days .	Transmission may also occur through wild animals , such as wild boar , which can spread the disease between farms .	People who work with poultry and swine , especially those with intense exposures , are at increased risk of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals , and constitute a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can co-occur .
