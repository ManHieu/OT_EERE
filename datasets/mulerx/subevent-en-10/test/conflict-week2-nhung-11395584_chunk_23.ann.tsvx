Text	Neofit reluctantly agreed to preside over the ceremony and to issue a curse on both pieces of legislation .	On , Ottoman troops headed by Omar Pasha and assisted by Fuat Pasha stormed into Bucharest , partly as an attempt to prevent the extension of Russian presence over the Milcov River .	On the morning of that day , Fuat met with local public figures at his headquarters in Cotroceni , proclaiming the reestablishment of the _ Regulament _ and appointing Constantin Cantacuzino as _ Kaymakam _ of Wallachia .	While all revolutionaries who attended the meeting were placed under arrest , Ion Heliade Rădulescu and Christian Tell sought refuge at the British consulate in Bucharest , where they were received by Robert Gilmour Colquhoun in exchange for a sum of Austrian florins .	The radical faction around Nicolae Bălcescu and Gheorghe Magheru had planned resistance on the Danube , but their opinion had failed to rally significant appeal .
