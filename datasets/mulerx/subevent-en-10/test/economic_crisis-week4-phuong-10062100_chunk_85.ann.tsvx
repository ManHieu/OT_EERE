Text	Bank writedowns and losses on these investments totaled $ 523 billion .	Critics such as the FCIC argue the mistaken credit ratings stemmed from " flawed computer models , the pressure from financial firms that paid for the ratings , the relentless drive for market share , the lack of resources to do the job despite record profits , and the absence of meaningful public oversight " .	Structured investment was very profitable to the agencies and by 2007 accounted for just under half of Moody 's total ratings revenue and all of the revenue growth .	But profits were not guaranteed , and issuers played the agencies off one another , ' shopping ' around to find the best ratings , sometimes openly threatening to cut off business after insufficiently generous ratings .	Thus there was a conflict of interest between accommodating clients – for whom higher ratings meant higher earnings – and accurately rating the debt for the benefit of the debt buyer / investors – who provided zero revenue to the agencies .
