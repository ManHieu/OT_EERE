Text	This retraction significantly raised the stall speed of the left wing .	Thus , flying at the takeoff safety airspeed caused the left wing to stall while the right wing was still producing lift , so the aircraft banked sharply and uncontrollably to the left .	Simulator recreations held after the accident determined that " had the pilot maintained excess airspeed the accident may not have occurred . "	The crash of Flight 191 brought strong criticism from the media regarding the DC - 10 's safety and design .	The DC - 10 had been involved in two accidents related to the design of its cargo doors , American Airlines Flight 96 ( 1972 ) and Turkish Airlines Flight 981 ( 1974 ) .
