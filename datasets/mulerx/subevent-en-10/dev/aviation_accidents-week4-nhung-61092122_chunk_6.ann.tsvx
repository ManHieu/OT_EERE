Text	This was probably caused by the fatigue of the pilot , who , at the request of the deputy chief of the airport , was delayed from the night shift and had been working for around 14 hours .	At 10:38 , the control tower was informed that cloud cover had dropped from 1100 to 450 meters , however , this information was not communicated to the crew of Flight 663 either .	When the crew tried to circumvent the thunderstorm in the conditions of limited visibility , they did not notice that they were right on the mountains .	The lack of visibility and communication resulted in the aircraft colliding with the mountain .	1 . The air traffic controllers allowed a visual flight at an altitude of 1500 meters in a mountainous area without meteorological conditions .
