Text	The flyer was later traced to a printing shop operated by two anarchists , typesetter Andrea Salsedo and compositor Roberto Elia , who were both Galleanists according to the later memoirs of other members .	Salsedo committed suicide and Elia refused an offer to cancel deportation proceedings if he would testify about his role in the Galleanist organization .	Unable to secure enough evidence for criminal trials , authorities continued to use the Anarchist Exclusion Act and related statutes to deport known Galleanists .	Fueled by labor unrest and the anarchist bombings and then spurred on by Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer 's attempt to suppress radical and non-radical labor organizations , the response to the bombings was characterized by exaggerated rhetoric , illegal search and seizures , unwarranted arrests and detentions and the deportation of several hundred suspected radicals and anarchists .	Palmer , twice targeted by anarchist bombs , organized the nationwide series of police actions known as the Palmer raids in November 1919 and January 1920 .
