Text	The failure of these seals allowed a flame thrower - like flare to impinge upon one of two aft SRB attach struts , which eventually failed , freeing the booster to pivot about its remaining attachment points .	The forward part of the booster cylinder struck the external tank inter-tank area , leading to a structural failure of the Space Shuttle external tank ( ET ) â€“ the core structural component of the entire stack .	A rapid burning of liberated propellants ensued .	With the structural " backbone " of the stack compromised and breaking up , the SRBs flew off on their own , as did the orbiter , which rapidly disintegrated due to overwhelming aerodynamic forces .	The launch had been approved despite a predicted ambient temperature of , well below the qualification limit of major components such as the SRBs , which had been certified for use only at temperatures above .
