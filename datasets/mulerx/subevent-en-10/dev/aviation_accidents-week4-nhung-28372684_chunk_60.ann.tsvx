Text	During evaluation flight , landing gear extension system fails with gear only partly deployed when in - cockpit crank handle breaks off .	Through a series of violent maneuvers , test pilot Lt. Harrison Crocker managed to get the gear retracted and was planning to attempt a belly - landing , but upon orders from the ground , sent aloft written on the sides of Boeing P- 12D And Douglas O- 25C aircraft , he bails out .	Four Y1P - 24 pre-production models cancelled due to Detroit Aircraft 's shaky financial situation .	Two will be built as Consolidated Y1P- 25s after Detroit 's chief designer Robert Wood joins that firm .	Second Y1P - 25 completed with a supercharger as Y1A - 11 .
