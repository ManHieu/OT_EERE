Text	The government and the ruling party CPI ( M ) have throughout maintained that the movement of Lalgarh was instigated and somewhat led by Maoist agents , many of whom have come from Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh .	The police from the beginning blamed the Maoists for the Shalboni blast and raided the villages and detained people for having suspected Maoist Links .	The police alleged that Sasadhar Mahato and other Maoist action squad members planned the Shalboni blast while in Bashber village , Lalgarh .	The Maoists soon accepted responsibility of the blast and congratulated the people of Lalgarh for their protest , but stopped short if claiming the movement to be under their control .	The people of Lalgarh however continually maintained that their movement was peaceful and for demand of basic democratic rights .
