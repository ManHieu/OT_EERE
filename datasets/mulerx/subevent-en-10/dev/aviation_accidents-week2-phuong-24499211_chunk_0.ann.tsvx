Text	Lieutenant JOHN MONCRIEFF and Captain GEORGE HOOD were two New Zealanders who vanished on 10 January 1928 while attempting the first trans-Tasman flight from Australia to New Zealand .	Radio signals were received from their aircraft for 12 hours after their departure from Sydney , but despite a number of purported sightings in New Zealand , and many land searches in the intervening years , no trace of the aviators or their aircraft has ever been found .	John Robert Moncrieff was a New Zealander by adoption , being born at Lerwick in the Shetland Islands on 22 September 1894 .	Educated at Leith Academy in Scotland , he emigrated to New Zealand early at the age of 16 and trained as a motor engineer .	He enlisted in the armed forces in December 1917 , and took a flying course with the Canterbury ( NZ ) Aviation Company at the Sockburn aerodrome ( later renamed Wigram Aerodrome ) .
