Text	Evidence suggested that Cooper was knowledgeable about flying technique , aircraft , and the terrain .	He demanded four parachutes to force the assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him , thus ensuring he would not be deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment .	He chose a 727 - 100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail - out escape , owing not only to its aft airstair but also to the high , aftward placement of all three engines , which allowed a reasonably safe jump despite the proximity of the engine exhaust .	It had " single - point fueling " capability , a then - recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port .	It also had the ability ( unusual for a commercial jet airliner ) to remain in slow , low - altitude flight without stalling , and Cooper knew how to control its airspeed and altitude without entering the cockpit , where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots .
