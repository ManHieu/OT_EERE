Text	When he came back to the United States and worked in Wild West shows , he slowly began adding the occasional spoken ad lib , such as " Swingin' a rope 's all right ... if your neck ain't in it . "	Audiences responded to his laconic but pointed humor , and were just as fascinated by his frontier Oklahoma twang .	By 1916 , Rogers was a featured star in Ziegfeld 's Follies on Broadway , as he moved into satire by transforming the " Ropin' Fool " to the " Talkin' Fool " .	At one performance , with President Woodrow Wilson in the audience , Rogers improvised a " roast " of presidential policies that had Wilson , and the entire audience , in stitches and proved his remarkable skill at off - the - cuff , witty commentary on current events .	He built the rest of his career around that skill .
