Text	Therefore , the Safety Board can only conclude that the flight crew failed to relate the fuel remaining and the rate of fuel flow to the time and distance from the airport , because their attention was directed almost entirely toward diagnosing the landing gear problem . "	The failure of the captain to monitor properly the aircraft 's fuel state and to properly respond to the low fuel state and the crewmember 's advisories regarding fuel state .	This resulted in fuel exhaustion to all engines .	His inattention resulted from preoccupation with a landing gear malfunction and preparations for a possible landing emergency .	The failure of the other two flight crewmembers either to fully comprehend the criticality of the fuel state or to successfully communicate their concern to the captain
