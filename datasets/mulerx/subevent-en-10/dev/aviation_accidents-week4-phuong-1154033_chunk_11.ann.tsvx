Text	The accident was investigated by the Indonesian NTSC , which was assisted by expert groups from the US , Singapore , and Australia .	Around 73 % of the wreckage ( by weight ) was recovered , partially reconstructed , and examined .	Both of the aircraft recorders , the CVR and the FDR , were retrieved from the river and their data were extracted and analyzed .	The investigators tested 20 different simulations for various equipment - failure scenarios , and found that the only scenario that matched the actual radar trajectory of the descent and crash of the flight was a high - speed steep dive commanded by one of the pilots .	Furthermore , the investigators had found the trim jack screw for the horizontal stabilizer , which revealed that flight inputs from one of the pilots had moved the stabilizer from level flight to a full nose - down descent .
