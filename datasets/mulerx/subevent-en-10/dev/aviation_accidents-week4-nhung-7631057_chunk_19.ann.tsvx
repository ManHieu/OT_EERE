Text	When announcing the distance remaining to Maputo the navigator was apparently referring to the Doppler navigation system , which was not accurate , rather than the DME equipment available on board which correctly displayed the distance to the Maputo DME beacon .	The crew were criticized for failing to perform any checklist items or navigational aid identification , as well as for the distractions and non-essential conversations in the cockpit during the descent into Maputo .	As a consequence of not announcing to the other crew members which navigational aids were being used , or the frequencies being set , mistakes could not be corrected by others through " cross-checking " .	Regarding it essential that the relatively large crew in the cockpit work as a well - integrated team , the board concluded that " demonstrably they had not " .	The board found that use of non-standard phraseology between the Maputo controller and the crew led to confusion about the status of the ILS signal and whether the runway lights were on .
