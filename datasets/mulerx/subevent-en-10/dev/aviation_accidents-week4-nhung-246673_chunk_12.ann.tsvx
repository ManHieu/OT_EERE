Text	During the investigation , an examination on the pylon attachment points revealed some damage done to the wing 's pylon mounting bracket that matched the bent shape of the pylon 's rear attachment fitting .	This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point .	This was important evidence , as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing 's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine / pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself .	Therefore , investigators now could conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash actually occurred , rather than being caused by it .	The NTSB determined that the damage to the left - wing engine pylon had occurred during an earlier engine change at the American Airlines aircraft maintenance facility in Tulsa , Oklahoma , between March 29 and 30 , 1979 .
