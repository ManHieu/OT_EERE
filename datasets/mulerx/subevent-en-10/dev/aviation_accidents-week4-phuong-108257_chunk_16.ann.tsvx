Text	When KAL 007 did not reach Bethel at 50 minutes after take off , a military radar at King Salmon , Alaska , tracked KAL 007 at north of where it should have been .	There is no evidence to indicate that civil air traffic controllers or military radar personnel at Elmendorf Air Force Base ( who were in a position to receive the King Salmon radar output ) were aware of KAL 007 's deviation in real - time , and therefore able to warn the aircraft .	It had exceeded its expected maximum deviation six fold , of error being the maximum expected drift from course if the inertial navigation system was activated .	KAL_007 's divergence prevented the aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range very high frequency radio ( VHF ) .	It therefore requested KAL 015 , also en route to Seoul , to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf .
