Text	The parked airplane that was struck by the DC - 6 burned so extensively that little remained of it afterwards .	The Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) held a hearing in Dallas in December 1949 to investigate the causes of the accident .	During the hearings , it was revealed that neither Claude nor Forbes knew that Lewis had feathered the No. 4 propeller ; Claude did not find out until hearing Lewis ' statement being read to the CAB .	After investigating the remains of the aircraft , conducting flight tests to replicate the accident scenario , and completing the hearing , the CAB concluded in August 1950 that the probable cause of the accident was " the faulty execution of an engine - out approach . "	A series of significant mishaps by the crew contributed to the final outcome :
