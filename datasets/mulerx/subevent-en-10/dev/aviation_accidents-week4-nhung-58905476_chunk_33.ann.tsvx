Text	The impact was so powerful that the strongest part of the aircraft was obliterated .	The NTSC also stated that the engines of Flight 610 were still running when it crashed into the sea , indicated by the high RPM .	Further examination of the aircraft 's instruments revealed that one of the aircraft 's airspeed indicators had malfunctioned for its last four flights , including the flight to Denpasar .	On 7 November , the NTSC confirmed that there had been problems with Flight 610 's angle of attack ( AoA ) sensors .	Thinking that it would fix the problem , the engineers in Bali then replaced one of the aircraft 's AoA sensors , but the problem persisted on the penultimate flight , from Denpasar to Jakarta .
