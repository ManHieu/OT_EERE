Text	The airline operated mostly Avro aircraft : Yorks , Lancastrians and Tudors , and flew to Bermuda , the West Indies and the western coast of South America .	_ Star Tiger _ was one of three enlarged and improved versions of the Avro Tudor , designated Tudor IV ; it had made 11 transatlantic flights , a total of 575 hours flying time , since its initial test flight on 4 November 1947 .	On the morning of 28 January 1948 , the crew and passengers boarded _ Star Tiger _ at Lisbon only to be forced to return to the airport waiting room when the pilot , Captain Brian W. McMillan , told them that the port inner engine needed some attention .	The aircraft took off 2 hours later , and made what was intended to be a 75 - minute refuelling stop at Santa Maria in the Azores .	However , the reported weather was so poor that Captain McMillan decided they should stop over until the next day .
