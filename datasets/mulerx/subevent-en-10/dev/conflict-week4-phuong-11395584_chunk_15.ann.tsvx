Text	Support for the Provisional Government began to be tested when the issue of land reform and corvées was again brought to the forefront .	Aside from the important conservative forces , opponents of the measure were to be found inside the leadership body itself , and included the moderates Heliade Rădulescu and Ioan Odobescu .	Revolutionaries who favored passing land into the property of peasants were divided over the amount that was to be ceded , as well as over the issue of compensation to be paid to boyars .	A compromise was reached through postponing , with a decision taken to submit all proposals to the vote of the Assembly , which was yet to be convened , instead of drafting a decree .	Nevertheless , a Proclamation to estate - holders was issued ( June 28 , 1848 ) , indicating that the reform was to be eventually enforced in exchange for unspecified sums , and calling on peasants to fulfill their corvées until autumn of the same year .
