Text	On 31 October 1944 , Foskett was returning to base following an operation when his Spitfire developed engine trouble between the islands of Skiathos and Skópelos over the Aegean Sea .	He attempted to bail out of the aircraft , but his altitude was too low for his parachute to open , and he was consequently killed .	Foskett 's body was later recovered , and he was buried at sea ; he is commemorated on the Malta Memorial .	Foskett 's younger brother Bruce William , a Royal Australian Air Force navigator , had been killed in an operation over Berlin the previous February .	By the time of his death , Foskett had been officially credited with a tally of 6 ½ Axis aircraft shot down .
