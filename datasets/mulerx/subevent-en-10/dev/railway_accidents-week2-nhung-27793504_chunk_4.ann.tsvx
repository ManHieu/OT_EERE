Text	One misunderstanding that contributed in large part to the disaster was that Takoma Park station was closed between 6:30 pm and 6:30 am each day , when no signals would have been displayed ; in these circumstances the previous block ( controlled by signals at Silver Spring ) extends beyond Terra Cotta .	No. 2120 had received a clear signal from Silver Spring , so the engineer believed he was cleared through to University .	Further inquiries also revealed that the engineer had been on almost continuous duty for 33 hours and had not had a full night 's sleep for 57 hours .	Four men were charged with manslaughter — the engineer , conductor , brakeman and fireman of train 2120 — but after a lengthy trial all were found not guilty due to lack of evidence .	Nonetheless , the Interstate Commerce Commission blamed them , claiming all were negligent .
