Text	In May 2013 , 31 people were arrested in connection with the theft , and some of the diamonds were recovered .	Charges were brought against 19 of those ( 16 men and 3 women ) .	In contrast to the clockwork execution of the robbery , the arrests came as a result of mistakes made when the suspects tried to sell the stolen goods .	Pascal Pont , a Swiss real estate agent , was given a large sack of diamonds from his friend Marc Bertoldi , a luxury car dealer from the French Riviera , whose car was discovered in the vicinity of the robbery .	Pont was investigated for his relationship with Bertoldi , and by monitoring his phone calls , police uncovered Pont 's unsuccessful attempts to fence the diamonds in Geneva , which is not a city known for its diamond trade .
