Text	Hudson and Reckard cited interviews and court statements by 32 former Ameriquest employees who said the company had abused its customers and broken the law , " deceiving borrowers about the terms of their loans , forging documents , falsifying appraisals and fabricating borrowers ' income to qualify them for loans they couldn't afford " .	Ameriquest later agreed to pay a $ 325 million predatory lending settlement with state authorities across the nation .	Some subprime lending advocates , such as the National Home Equity Mortgage Association ( NHEMA ) , say many practices commonly called " predatory , " particularly the practice of risk - based pricing , are not actually predatory , and that many laws aimed at reducing " predatory lending " significantly restrict the availability of mortgage finance to lower - income borrowers .	Such parties consider _ predatory lending _ a pejorative term .	- JUDICIAL PRACTICES : Some argue that much of the problem arises from a tendency of the courts to favor lenders , and to shift the burden of proof of compliance with the terms of the debt instrument to the debtor .
