Text	These multi-track communications from various command posts telecommunicating at the same minute and seconds as other command posts were communicating provide a " composite " picture of what was taking place .	The data from the CVR and the FDR revealed that the recordings broke off after the first minute and 44 seconds of KAL 007 's post missile detonation 12 minute flight .	The remaining minutes of flight would be supplied by the Russia 1992 submission to ICAO of the real - time Soviet military communication of the shootdown and aftermath .	The fact that both recorder tapes stopped exactly at the same time 1 minute and 44 seconds after missile detonation ( 18:38:02 UTC ) without the tape portions for the more than 10 minutes of KAL 007 's post detonation flight before it descended below radar tracking ( 18:38 UTC ) finds no explanation in the ICAO analysis :	" It could not be established why both flight recorders simultaneously ceased to operate 104 seconds after the attack .
