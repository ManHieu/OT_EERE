Text	Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal , and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO , the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed that might have embarrassed the administration or contradicted its version of events .	Unlike the NTSB , ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved — in this incident , the United States , the Soviet Union , Japan , and South Korea — to supply evidence voluntarily .	The International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) had only one experience of investigation of an air disaster prior to the KAL 007 shootdown .	This was the incident of February 21 , 1973 , when Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 was shot down by Israeli F - 4 jets over the Sinai Peninsula .	ICAO convention required the state in whose territory the accident had taken place ( the Soviet Union ) to conduct an investigation together with the country of registration ( South Korea ) , the country whose air traffic control the aircraft was flying under ( Japan ) , as well as the country of the aircraft 's manufacturer ( USA ) .
