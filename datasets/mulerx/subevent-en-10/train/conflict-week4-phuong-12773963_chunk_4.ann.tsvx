Text	In October or November 615 BC , the Medes , another ancient enemy of Assyria , under King Cyaxares entered Assyria and conquered the region around the city Arrapha in preparation for a great final campaign against Sinsharishkun .	In July or August of 614 BC , the Medes mounted attacks on the cities of Kalhu and Nineveh and successfully conquered the city Tarbisu .	They then besieged Assur .	This siege was successful and the Medes captured the ancient heart of Assyria , plundering it and killing many of its inhabitants .	Nabopolassar only arrived at Assur after the plunder had already begun and met with Cyaxares , allying with him and signing an anti-Assyrian pact .
