Text	[ Memorial to the Buddhists killed in the demonstrations during the Phat Dan of 1963 in Hue , Vietnam . ]	The HUẾ PHẬT ĐẢN SHOOTINGS were the deaths of nine unarmed Buddhist civilians on 8 May 1963 in the city of Huế , South Vietnam at the hands of the army and security forces of the government of Ngô Đình Diệm , a Roman Catholic .	The army and police fired guns and launched grenades into a crowd of Buddhists who had been protesting against a government ban on flying the Buddhist flag on the day of Phật Đản , which commemorates the birth of Gautama Buddha .	Diệm denied governmental responsibility for the incident and blamed the Việt Cộng , which added to discontent among the Buddhist majority .	The incident spurred a protest movement by Buddhists against the religious discrimination which they felt was perpetrated by the Diệm regime , known as the _ Buddhist crisis _ , and this led to widespread civil disobedience among the South Vietnamese .
