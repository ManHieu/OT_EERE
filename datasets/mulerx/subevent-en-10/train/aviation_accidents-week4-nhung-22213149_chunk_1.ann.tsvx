Text	Following the plane 's departure from Tashkent on the previous flight segment , one of its inertial navigation units ( INUs ) had partially failed , providing erroneous roll data to the captain 's attitude director indicator ( ADI or artificial horizon ) .	The first officer 's ADI and a backup ADI were correct , a comparator alarm called attention to the discrepancy , and in daylight the erroneous indication was easily identified .	The ADI 's input selector was switched to the other INU and the correct indications returned .	At Stansted , the engineers who attempted to repair the ADI did not have the correct Fault Isolation Manual available and did not think of replacing the INU .	One of them identified and repaired a damaged connecting plug on the ADI .
