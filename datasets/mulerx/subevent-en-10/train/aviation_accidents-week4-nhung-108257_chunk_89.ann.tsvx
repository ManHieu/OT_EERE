Text	The power supply cables were fed to the rear of the aircraft in raceways on opposite sides of the fuselage until they came together behind the two recorders . "	Passenger pain and suffering was an important factor in determining the level of compensation that was paid by Korean Air Lines .	Fragments from the proximity fused R - 98 medium range air - to - air missile exploding behind the tail caused punctures to the pressurized passenger cabin .	When one of the flight crew radioed Tokyo Area Control one minute and two seconds after missile detonation his breathing was already " accentuated " , indicating to ICAO analysts that he was speaking through the microphone located in his oxygen mask , " Korean Air 007 ah ... We are ... Rapid compressions .	Descend to 10,000 . "
