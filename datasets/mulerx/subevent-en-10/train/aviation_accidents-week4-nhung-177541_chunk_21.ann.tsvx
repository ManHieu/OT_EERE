Text	In 2013 , Hale recalled that Director of Mission Operations Jon C. Harpold shared with him before__ Columbia_{{'}} s destruction a mindset which Hale himself later agreed was widespread at the time , even among the astronauts themselves :	Ultimately the NASA Mission Management Team felt there was in sufficient evidence to indicate that the strike was an unsafe situation , so they declared the debris strike a " turnaround " issue ( not of highest importance ) and denied the requests for the DoD images .	-____02:30 EST , February 1 , 2003_: The Entry Flight Control Team began duty in the Mission Control Center .	The Flight Control Team had not been working on any issues or problems related to the planned de-orbit and reentry of _ Columbia _ .	In particular , the team had indicated no concerns regarding the debris that hit the left wing during ascent , and treated the reentry like any other .
