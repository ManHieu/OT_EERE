Text	In the Cold War context of Operation RYAN , the Strategic Defence Initiative , Pershing II missile deployment in Europe , and the upcoming Exercise Able Archer , the Soviet Government perceived the incident with the South Korean airliner to be a portent of war .	The Soviet hierarchy took the official line that KAL Flight 007 was on a spy mission , as it " flew deep into Soviet territory for several hundred kilometres [ miles ] , without responding to signals and disobeying the orders of interceptor fighter planes " .	They claimed its purpose was to probe the air defences of highly sensitive Soviet military sites in the Kamchatka Peninsula and Sakhalin Island .	The Soviet government expressed regret over the loss of life , but offered no apology and did not respond to demands for compensation .	Instead , the Soviet Union blamed the CIA for this " criminal , provocative act " .
