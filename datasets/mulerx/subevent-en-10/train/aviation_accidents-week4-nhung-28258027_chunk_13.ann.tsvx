Text	The NTSB made several recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration .	Most notable among these were recommendations regarding fire safety equipment , emergency lighting , and crew instructions to passengers regarding the location of emergency exits and evacuation procedures .	The Board suggested that flight attendants physically point to the location of each exit when conducting the pre-flight passenger safety briefing , to increase passenger retention .	The Board also pointed to a need for emergency exit lighting , as well as clear , simple instruction for opening emergency exits , calling the instructions present on the accident aircraft " misleading . "	The Board also noted the limitations of the aircraft 's non-precision approach equipment , suggesting that a more precise instrument landing system could have reduced the likelihood of an accident .
