Text	On 12 February 2017 , the pro-government / anti-Iohannis protest continued for its 9th day with 400 protesters .	On 9 June 2018 , the ruling Social Democratic Party ( PSD ) organised a pro-government rally in Bucharest , which had over 100,000 attendants .	After receiving negative opinions from the judicial institutions regarding the government ordinance bills , President of Romania Klaus Iohannis stated on 20 January 2017 that the presidency requested the government to withdraw the government proposals .	Following the protests on 22 January 2017 , Klaus Iohannis announced that he would call for a referendum in order for the public opinion to have a say on these controversial issues .	He rebutted Dragnea 's claims of a coup by declaring that PSD was attempting a coup d'Ã©tat against the rule of law in the country , and that Romanians had the right to vote on these issues , especially since they were not part of PSD 's electoral programme upon which they won the 2016 parliamentary elections .
