Text	This disallowed the flying of Buddhist flags on Phật Đản , the birthday of Gautama Buddha .	The invoking official was the deputy province chief in charge of security , Major Đặng Sỹ , a Catholic who was charged with maintaining public security and was commander of the Huế garrison .	The application of the law caused indignation among Buddhists on the eve of the most important religious festival of the year , since a week earlier Catholics had been allowed to display Vatican flags to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the appointment of Diệm 's brother Thục as Archbishop of Huế .	The celebrations had been bankrolled by Diệm 's regime through a national committee which asked the population to donate money to Thục 's jubilee .	Buddhists complained that they had been forced to give a month 's wages to pay for the celebration .
