Text	The airspeed continued to slow to .	Six seconds later , the aircraft 's stick shaker activated , warning of an impending stall , as the speed continued to slow to .	The captain responded by abruptly pulling back on the control column , followed by increasing thrust to 75 % power , instead of lowering the nose and applying full power , which was the proper stall - recovery technique .	That improper action pitched the nose up even further , increasing both the g - load and the stall speed .	The stick pusher activated ( The Q400 stick pusher applies an airplane - nose - down control column input to decrease the wing 's angle of attack ( AOA ) after an aerodynamic stall ) , but the captain overrode the stick pusher and continued pulling back on the control column .
