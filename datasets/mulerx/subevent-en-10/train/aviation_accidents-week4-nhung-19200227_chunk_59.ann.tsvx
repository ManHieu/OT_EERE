Text	Prior to take off they had not factored in heat and humidity to the airplane performance , and so were now too heavy to maintain altitude on one engine .	In trying to maintain altitude , they slowed to 100 MPH , which made them sink even faster .	They ditched 8 miles from the southern tip of Guam .	The pilot failed to use flaps to lower his speed during landing , and landed with a 15 MPH tailwind , contributing to a hard landing , the aircraft nose tearing off , and two fatalities .	22 September : A U.S. Navy Lockheed P - 3B Orion , BuNo__152757_ of VP - 8 on flight out of Naval Air Station Brunswick , Maine , at 1205 hrs. en route to Trenton , Ontario for display at an air show , explodes in the air eight - ten minutes later and comes down over Poland , Maine .
