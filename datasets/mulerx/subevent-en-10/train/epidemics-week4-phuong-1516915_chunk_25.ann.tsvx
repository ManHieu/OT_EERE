Text	Alcohol - based gel or foam hand sanitizers work well to destroy viruses and bacteria .	Anyone with flu - like symptoms , such as a sudden fever , cough , or muscle aches , should stay away from work or public transportation and should contact a doctor for advice .	Social distancing , another tactic , is staying away from other people who might be infected , and can include avoiding large gatherings , spreading out a little at work , or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community .	Public health and other responsible authorities have action plans which may request or require social distancing actions , depending on the severity of the outbreak .	Vaccines are available for different kinds of swine flu .
