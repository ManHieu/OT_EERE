Text	The plague of Amwas first struck the Muslim Arab troops encamped there before spreading across Syria – Palestine and affecting Egypt and Iraq	The plague of Amwas ( _ta'un Amwas _ in Arabic ) was likely a bubonic plague epidemic , though the sources do not elaborate on specific symptoms of the disease .	It was the second recorded plague of the Islamic era , which began in the 620s , and the first to directly afflict the Muslims .	It was likely a reemergence of the Plague of Justinian , which originated in Pelusium ( near modern Suez ) in 541 AD and spread west to Alexandria and east to Palestine before reaching the Byzantine capital Constantinople in 541 – 542 and afflicting the rest of Europe and the Sasanian Empire , as noted by the Byzantine historian Procopius ( d. ) .	The Plague of Justinian recurred in at least nine to twelve cycles throughout the mid-6th century and the 7th century .
