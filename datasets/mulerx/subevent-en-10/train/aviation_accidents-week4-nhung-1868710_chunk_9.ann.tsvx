Text	Italian world bronze medalist Carlo Fassi was another international coach who relocated from overseas to help rebuild the U.S. Figure Skating program .	The disaster prompted U.S. Figure Skating executives to issue a mandate that still applies today : No team traveling to an international competition would ever be allowed to fly together again .	The Belgian Government immediately ordered a full inquiry into the cause of the accident , and an investigation was conducted by the Belgian National authorities , the United States Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) , and the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) , who spent several months combing through the evidence .	There was much speculation about what may have happened ; the FBI even reportedly considered the possibility of terrorism .	The exact cause of the crash was never fully determined , but the authorities eventually agreed that the most likely explanation was a mechanical failure of one of the flight control mechanisms , probably a malfunction of either the wing spoilers or the tail stabilizers .
