Text	In response to this accident , American Airlines was fined $ 500,000 ( equivalent to $ million in dollars ) by the U.S. government for improper maintenance procedures .	Earl Russell Marshall , one of the American Airlines mechanics who had last performed this maintenance procedure on the aircraft , subsequently committed suicide the night before he was to be deposed by McDonnell Douglas attorneys .	On June 6 , 1979 , two weeks after the crash , the FAA suspended the type certificate for the DC - 10 , thereby grounding all DC - 10s under its jurisdiction .	It also enacted a special air regulation banning the DC - 10 from U.S. airspace , which prevented foreign DC - 10s not under the jurisdiction of the FAA from flying within the country .	This was done while the FAA investigated whether the airplane 's engine mounting and pylon design met relevant requirements .
