Text	The captain , in the middle of a radio exchange , ceased his transmission and immediately took control of the aircraft , where he began to make pitch - up inputs on the flight controls .	During this time , the co-pilot declared a mayday , and the air traffic controller offered all options to the crew for an approach or diversion .	Although the aircraft began to climb , the captain felt that his increasing efforts on the flight controls did not seem to have the desired effect .	The co-pilot also applied nose - up inputs , but also perceived that the aircraft was not responding as expected .	The primary flight display ( PFD ) displayed pitch and roll mistrim warnings .
