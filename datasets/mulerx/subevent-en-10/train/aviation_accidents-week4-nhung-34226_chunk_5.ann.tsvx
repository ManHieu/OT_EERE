Text	On the land behind their house , the family was allowed to build a mud hut measuring approximately , where they spent 21 months until the end of the occupation .	During this period , Yuri became a saboteur , especially after one of the German soldiers , who the children called " the Devil " , tried to hang his younger brother Boris on an apple tree using the boy 's scarf .	In retaliation , Yuri sabotaged the soldier 's work ; he poured soil into the tank batteries gathered to be recharged and randomly mixed the different chemical supplies intended for the task .	In early 1943 , his two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour .	They escaped and were found by Soviet soldiers who conscripted them into helping with the war effort .
