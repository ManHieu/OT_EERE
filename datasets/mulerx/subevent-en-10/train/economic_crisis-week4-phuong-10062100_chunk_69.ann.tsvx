Text	Many financial institutions , investment banks in particular , issued large amounts of debt during 2004 â€“ 07 , and invested the proceeds in mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) , essentially betting that house prices would continue to rise , and that households would continue to make their mortgage payments .	Borrowing at a lower interest rate and investing the proceeds at a higher interest rate is a form of financial leverage .	This is analogous to an individual taking out a second mortgage on his residence to invest in the stock market .	This strategy proved profitable during the housing boom , but resulted in large losses when house prices began to decline and mortgages began to default .	Beginning in 2007 , financial institutions and individual investors holding MBS also suffered significant losses from mortgage payment defaults and the resulting decline in the value of MBS .
