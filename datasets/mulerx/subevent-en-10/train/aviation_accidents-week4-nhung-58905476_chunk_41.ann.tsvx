Text	On 15 November , the US Air Line Pilots Association ( ALPA ) , the largest pilots ' union , representing 61,000 pilots , urged the FAA and NTSB to ensure pilots receive all relevant information addressing a " potential , significant aviation system safety deficiency . "	ALPA 's United Airlines branch , in line with its management , disagrees as the 737 pilot manual includes a standard procedure to shut down the flight - control behavior , and dismissed the MCAS implication in the accident as " speculation " based on the Boeing safety - warning bulletin and the follow - on FAA airworthiness directive .	In an internal message on 19 November 2018 , Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg defended the Flight Crew Operations Manual as describing the relevant function of MCAS .	On 20 November , Boeing was to hold a conference call with 737 Max operators to detail the new MCAS not present in the Next Generation models .	The conference call was cancelled later , to be replaced by a series of regional calls to allow more questions .
