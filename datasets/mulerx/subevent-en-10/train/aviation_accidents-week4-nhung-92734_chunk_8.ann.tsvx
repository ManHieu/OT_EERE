Text	The Pan Am crew indicated that they would prefer to circle in a holding pattern until landing clearance was given ( they had enough fuel to safely stay in the air for two more hours ) , but they were ordered to divert to Tenerife .	Los Rodeos was a regional airport that could not easily accommodate all of the traffic diverted from Gran Canaria , which included five large airliners .	The airport had only one runway and one major taxiway running parallel to it , with four short taxiways connecting the two .	While waiting for Gran Canaria airport to reopen , the diverted airplanes took up so much space that they were having to park on the long taxiway , making it unavailable for the purpose of taxiing .	Instead , departing aircraft needed to taxi along the runway to position themselves for takeoff , a procedure known as a backtaxi or backtrack .
