Text	If the signal is fitted with TPWS , the driver resets the Driver Reminder Appliance , pushes the TPWS Trainstop Override button in the cab , and proceeds cautiously through the section .	If the train reaches the next signal without finding an obstruction , they must obey its aspect , at which point they can revert to normal working .	If contact with the signaller cannot be made then the driver must not move the train , unless it is standing at one of the following signals :	- An Intermediate Block Home signal - A signal controlled from a signal box that is closed - An automatic signal where local instructions permit it , e.g. signals within tunnels on the Northern City Line .	After passing a signal at danger under his own authority , the driver must stop at the next signal ( even if it is showing a proceed aspect ) and inform the signaller of what they have done .
