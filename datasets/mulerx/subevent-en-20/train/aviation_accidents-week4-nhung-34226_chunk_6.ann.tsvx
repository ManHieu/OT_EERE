Text	They did not return home until after the war , in 1945 .	The rest of the Gagarin family believed the two older children were dead , and Yuri became ill with " grief and hunger " ; he was also beaten for refusing to work for the German forces and spent the remainder of the war at a hospital as a patient and later as an orderly .	His mother was hospitalized during the same period , after a German soldier gashed her leg with a scythe .	When the Germans were routed out of Klushino on 9 March 1944 , Yuri helped the Red Army find mines buried in the roads by the fleeing German army .	In 1946 , the family moved to Gzhatsk , where Gagarin continued his education .
