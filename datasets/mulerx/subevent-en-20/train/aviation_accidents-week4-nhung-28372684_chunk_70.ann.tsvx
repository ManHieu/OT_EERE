Text	A stirring and unique air drama was played out in an impenetrable fog here tonight after 22 navy airplanes had been stranded with dwindling gasoline supplies in the sky , and at its conclusion every aviator involved was safe .	As a result of the long series of emergencies which developed as the fuel ran dangerously low in the planes , one at a time , one plane was demolished , another was badly damaged , one caught fire and several others turned over and were slightly damaged .	At 8 o'clock only two planes remained aloft , and they circled aimlessly about over the city watching for a break in the fog .	They carried no radios and could not be told that the navy 's call upon the citizens of San Diego for assistance had sent scores of motorists rushing to Camp Kearny mesa to light up with the headlights of their cars an unused airport there .	The United Airlines night mail plane , piloted by C._F. Sullivan , was en route from Los Angeles to San Diego .
