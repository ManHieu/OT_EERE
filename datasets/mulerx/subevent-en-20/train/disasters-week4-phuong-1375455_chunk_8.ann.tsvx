Text	The final over featured a partnership between spinners Daniel Vettori ( 27 not out ) and Shane Warne ( 2 not out ) , with Warne 's comeback to limited - overs cricket being greeting rapturously by the fans .	The innings ended on a somewhat farcical note , as Warne miscounted the number of balls left in the final over and began leaving the field with Vaas having one delivery left .	Rising to the occasion , umpire Bowden issued Warne with a " yellow card " , to cheers from the crowd .	Warne was recalled to the wicket and the World XI finished with a total of 344 for 8 .	As match sponsors Travelex were pledging a donation of A $ 1,000 per run , and Toyota A $ 50,000 for each for the six sixes , the World XI had earned A $ 644,000 .
