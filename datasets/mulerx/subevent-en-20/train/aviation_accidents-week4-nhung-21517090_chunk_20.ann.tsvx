Text	Another press report said that the pilot had failed five prior tests , and also alleged " flirtatious " conversation in the cockpit between the pilot and the much younger first officer .	In response to questioning from the NTSB , Colgan Air officials acknowledged both pilots apparently were not paying close attention to the aircraft 's instruments , and did not properly follow the airline 's procedures for handling an impending stall .	" I believe Capt. Renslow did have intentions of landing safely at Buffalo , as well as first officer Shaw , but obviously in those last few moments ... the flight instruments were not being monitored , and that 's an indication of a lack of situational awareness , " said John Barrett , Colgan 's director of flight standards .	The official transcript of the crew 's communication , obtained from the CVR , as well as an animated depiction of the crash , constructed using data from the FDR , were made available to the public on May 12 , 2009 .	Some of the crew 's communication violated federal rules banning nonessential conversation .
