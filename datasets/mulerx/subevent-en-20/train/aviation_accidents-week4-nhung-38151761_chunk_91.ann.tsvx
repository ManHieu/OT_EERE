Text	The Hornet was a nearly new airframe with only 327 flying hours being used in the operational testing of the design .	Investigators pinpointed the planing link on the undercarriage whose task is to guide the gear components ' complex manoeuvers during retraction as a probable cause .	If damaged during retraction after departing Point Mugu , the link may have caused the starboard wheel to be slightly out of line .	As the fighter 's weight settled onto the gear leg , the airframe may have swerved so sharply that the pilot was unable to maintain control .	Repaired , this airframe is struck off charge on 27 June 2007 , and is now displayed at Patriots Point , Charleston , South Carolina .
