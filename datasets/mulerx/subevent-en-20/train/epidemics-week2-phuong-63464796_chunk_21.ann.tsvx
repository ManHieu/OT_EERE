Text	The season 's poor harvests and hunger in the Spanish population , as well as negligent medical care , likely contributed to the severity of the influenza pandemic in Spain .	Flu symptoms could be so intense that the region 's physicians often distinguished it from other contagious , seasonal pneumonias that spread from East Europe .	Sixteenth century Spaniards frequently referred to any mass outbreak of deadly disease generically as a _ pestilencia _ , and " plagues " are recognized as occurring in Valencia and Granada during the years 1557 â€“ 59 , despite pathological records of true plague ( like descriptions of buboes ) occurring in the area at the time being scant .	Influenza hit the Kingdom of Portugal at the same time as it spread throughout Spain , with an impact that spread across the Atlantic Ocean .	The kingdom had just suffered food shortages due to 1556 - 57 's poor harvest , which would have exacerbated the effects of the flu on hungry patients .
