Text	People refused to bury their dead , who were instead buried by a special group of grave diggers recruited from the poorest beggars , the _ becchini _ , who charged enormous sums to throw the bodies in mass graves .	Those who could not pay left the bodies on the street , which were soon full of rotting corpses .	In the countryside outside Florence , the peasantry fell down dead in their fields which were abandoned by the living , who let loose their animals and ate their supplies because they lost the hope of surviving .	Matteo Villani described how people in Florence , expecting their death , lived to enjoy life without consequences : the poor ignored the class system and started to eat luxury food and dress in fashion of dead aristocrats , and how people started to marry anyone they wished without considering class , status or suitability .	Giovanni Boccaccio claimed that 100.000 people died in Florence .
