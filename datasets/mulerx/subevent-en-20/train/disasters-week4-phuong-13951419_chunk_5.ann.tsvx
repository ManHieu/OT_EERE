Text	In 1997 , the now - unemployed Baumhammers travelled to Riga , Latvia , where he lived in an apartment on Kr. Barona Avenue , less than a block away from where his grandparents had lived in the mid-1930s .	He acquired Latvian citizenship , and went about seeking to regain some of the family 's properties lost during the Soviet occupation of Latvia .	He made a claim under Latvia 's de-nationalization process but was too late , as any claims had been required to be filed by 1996 .	According to several people who associated with him in Latvia , Baumhammers kept mostly to himself and when he did socialize , he seemed to have felt most comfortable spending time with native Latvians , and a few passing Latvian Americans .	Those who met him in Latvia said they did not recall Baumhammers being prone to violence or ever espousing any racist remarks , and the Latvian government has no record of Baumhammers ever getting in trouble with authorities .
