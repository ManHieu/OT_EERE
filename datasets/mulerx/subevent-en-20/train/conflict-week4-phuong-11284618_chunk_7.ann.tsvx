Text	Two near - casualties of the same bomb were Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor , then living across the street from Palmer .	They had passed the house just minutes before the explosion and their residence was close enough that one of the bomber 's body parts landed on their doorstep .	Each of the bombs was delivered with several copies of a pink flyer , titled " Plain Words " , that read as such :	War , Class war , and you were the first to wage it under the cover of the powerful institutions you call order , in the darkness of your laws .	There will have to be bloodshed ; we will not dodge ; there will have to be murder : we will kill , because it is necessary ; there will have to be destruction ; we will destroy to rid the world of your tyrannical institutions .
