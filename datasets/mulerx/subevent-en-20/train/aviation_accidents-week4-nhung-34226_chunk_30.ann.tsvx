Text	In a 2006 interview , Gagarin 's friend Colonel Valentin Petrov stated that Gagarin never said these words and that the quote originated from Khrushchev 's speech at the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU about the state 's anti-religion campaign , saying " Gagarin flew into space , but didn't see any god there " .	Petrov also said Gagarin had been baptised into the Russian Orthodox Church as a child , and a 2011__Foma__magazine article quoted the rector of the Orthodox Church in Star City saying , " Gagarin baptized his elder daughter Yelena shortly before his space flight ; and his family used to celebrate Christmas and Easter and keep icons in the house " .	On 27 March 1968 , while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base , Gagarin and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died when their MiG - 15 UTI crashed near the town of Kirzhach .	The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and their ashes interred in the walls of the Kremlin .	Wrapped in secrecy , the cause of the crash that killed Gagarin is uncertain and became the subject of several theories , including several conspiracy theories .
