Text	A monument to the victims was built in Ben Shemen forest in Israel .	Occurring less than a month after the September 11 attacks in the United States , the crash was initially suspected by Russian officials to be an act of terrorism , and they denied American reports that it was caused by an S - 200 missile .	Later , the Moscow - based Interstate Aviation Committee ruled that the crash was caused by an accidental Ukrainian S - 200 missile strike during military training exercises staged off Cape Opuk in Crimea .	Initial private assessments by American military officials determined that the crash was caused by a S - 200 missile that had overshot its target drone — which had been destroyed successfully by an S - 300 fired at the same time — and instead of self - destructing , locked on the passenger plane about further away and detonated over the plane .	Russian officials dismissed the American claim as " unworthy of attention , " and Russian president Vladimir Putin told the press the next day that " the weapons used in those exercises had such characteristics that make it impossible for them to reach the air corridor through which the plane was moving .
