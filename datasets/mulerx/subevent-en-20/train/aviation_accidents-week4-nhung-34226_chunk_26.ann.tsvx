Text	The Soyuz 1 launch was rushed due to implicit political pressures and despite Gagarin 's protests that additional safety precautions were necessary .	Gagarin accompanied Komarov to the rocket before launch and relayed instructions to Komarov from ground control following multiple system failures aboard the spacecraft .	Despite their best efforts , Soyuz 1 crash landed after its parachutes failed to open , killing Komarov instantly .	After the Soyuz 1 crash , Gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights .	He was also grounded from flying aircraft solo , a demotion he worked hard to lift .
