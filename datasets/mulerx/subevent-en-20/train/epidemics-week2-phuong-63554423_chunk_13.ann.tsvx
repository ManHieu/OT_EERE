Text	When the ship arrived in Guam on 26 March the ship 's commanding officer , Captain Brett Crozier , wanted to have most of the crew immediately taken ashore , saying it was impossible to prevent the spread of the virus in the close quarters of the ship .	Rear Adm. Stuart P. Baker , who was the commanding officer of Carrier Strike Group 9 and thus Crozier 's immediate superior , disagreed , feeling such an action was impractical and too drastic .	On 30 March , Crozier sent an email to communicate the status of his ship and her crew , saying it was not possible to observe CDC / Navy recommendations for individual quarantine or social distancing aboard the carrier .	Crozier referred to the viral spread on the less crowded cruise ship _ Diamond Princess _ as an example of how quickly a virus can spread on a crowded vessel .	The letter provided his superiors with options , including ready for battle while sick , but recommended most of the crew 's evacuation , keeping only enough crew on board to maintain the nuclear reactors , provide security , and to sanitize the ship .
