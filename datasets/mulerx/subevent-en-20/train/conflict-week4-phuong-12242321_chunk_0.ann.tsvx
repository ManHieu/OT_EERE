Text	The POLISH – TEUTONIC WAR ( 1326 – 1332 ) was the war between the Kingdom of Poland and the State of the Teutonic Order over Pomerelia , fought from 1326 to 1332 .	Until the death of Duke Mestwin II in 1294 , the Duchy of Pomerelia on the Baltic coast , stretching from the border with the Imperial Duchy of Pomerania in the west to the Prussian territory of the Order state at the Vistula river in the east , had been held by the Samborides dynasty , liensmen of the Polish Piast rulers .	Przemysł II , King of Poland since 1295 , incorporated Pomerelia ( ) into the Lands of the Polish Crown , against the protest of the Imperial Margraviate of Brandenburg referring to the Treaty of Arnswalde signed with Duke Mestwin in 1269 .	The next year , the Ascanian margraves instigated the kidnapping and killing of King Przemysł , probably backed by King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia , who aimed for the Polish crown .	King Wenceslaus II prevailed against his Piast rival Władysław I the Elbow - high and was crowned King of Poland in 1300 .
