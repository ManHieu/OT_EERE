Text	The vast majority of these items could only be acquired through purchasing loot boxes , and the most sought - after item ( a cosmetic axe for one of the player characters ) could only be purchased at an additional cost after first having obtained 24 other purchasable items .	Players and media outlets decried that as a result of this transaction model , the cost of the most sought - after item was approximately $ 170 ( or £ 130 ) — a price point which _ Forbes _ called " hilariously out of touch " and compared negatively to most other major microtransaction models in the industry .	This resulted in a negative backlash from the player community and industry journalists , particularly on Reddit , where members of the _ Apex Legends _ community forum traded insults with developers of the game with the increasingly strong language being used by both parties .	As a result , Respawn Entertainment apologized for what they agreed was unfair monetization and promised to allow players the chance to purchase cosmetic items directly ( rather than rely on loot boxes ) , albeit at an increased price .	Respawn Entertainment CEO Vince Zampella later apologized for members of the development team " crossing a line with their comments " , while also defending that they stood up for themselves against alleged death threats and insults aimed at their family members .
