Text	Excitement mounted in New Zealand during the day , and by early evening an estimated 10,000 people had arrived at Trentham to greet the airmen , including Dorothy Moncrieff and Laura Hood , the aviators ' wives .	[ Search activity for Hood and Moncrieff drawn on 1885 map of New Zealand ]	At 17:22 NZ time , when the aircraft had been in the air for just over 12 hours , and should have been within about off New Zealand 's coast , signals from the _ Aotearoa _ ceased abruptly .	With the cessation of radio signals hopefulness gave way to anxiety , although the relatively poor reliability of airborne radio at the time did not necessarily mean that loss of signal equalled the loss of the aircraft .
