Text	Two members of the group approached Admiral Guzm√°n in the cabin and informed him of the hijacking , at which point his _ aide-de-camp _ attempted to get his pistol but was struck down by one of the hijackers .	In order not to frighten the passengers , they were informed that the aircraft was diverting to Comodoro Rivadavia airport .	The captain managed to find the Falklands thanks to the differences in the pattern of cloud cover over the islands .	After circling , they were able to locate Stanley through a clearing in the clouds .	At that time , there were no active airports on the islands , so the captain landed on Stanley Racecourse at 08:42 .
