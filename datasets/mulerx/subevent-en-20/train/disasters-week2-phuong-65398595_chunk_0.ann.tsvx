Text	ANTICYCLONE HARTMUT ( dubbed the _ BEAST FROM THE EAST_ ( ) ) was a storm that began on 22 February 2018 , and brought a cold wave to Great Britain and Ireland .	Anticyclone Hartmut also brought widespread unusually low temperatures and heavy snowfall to large areas .	The cold wave combined with Storm Emma , part of the 2017 â€“ 18 European windstorm season , which made landfall in southwest England and the south of Ireland on 2 March .	In contrast to usual winter storms , Hartmut was not formed as a normal low pressure area along the jetstream .	The initial event was an Arctic outbreak caused by a disordered polar vortex into Central Europe , transporting not only cold air from Siberia to Europe , but due to the lake effect , sent much snow into Great Britain and Ireland .
