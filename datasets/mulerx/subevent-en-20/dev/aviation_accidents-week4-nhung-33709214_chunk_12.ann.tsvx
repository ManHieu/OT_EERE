Text	Searchers were unable to find the chock for the other elevator or the right aileron , either at the crash site or on the ground between the runway and the crash site .	On the morning after the accident an MMA apprentice found the missing elevator chock on the tarmac close to where VH - MME was positioned for an engine test run the previous afternoon .	The investigators carried out a flight test on a DC - 3 to determine what effect , if any , was caused by installing an aileron chock on the elevator .	They found there was no effect and the presence of the chock did not prevent the pilot having full control of the elevator .	Staff of the Department of Civil Aviation calculated the most likely position of the centre of gravity on the fatal flight and found it was about 3.3 % of Mean Aerodynamic Chord behind the rear limit .
