Text	There have been several other derailments in the UK due to trains entering speed - restricted sections of track at excessive speed ; the causes have generally been inattention by the driver due to alcohol , fatigue or other causes .	Prominent cases were the Nuneaton rail crash in 1975 ( temporary speed restriction in force due to trackwork , warning sign illumination failed ) , the Morpeth accident in 1984 ( express passenger sleeping car train took restricted sharp curve at full speed ; alcohol a factor ; no fatalities due to the improved crashworthiness of the vehicles )	[ This locomotive was derailed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake .	The locomotive had three link and pin coupler pockets for moving standard and narrow gauge cars . ]	George D Bibel , _ Train Wreck â€“ the Forensics of Rail Disasters _ , Hopkins University Press , Baltimore , 2012 ,
