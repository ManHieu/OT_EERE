Text	Operation Spring succeeded in its later - defined objective of a " holding attack " and aided the overwhelming success of Operation Cobra , by tying down powerful German formations that might otherwise have been in the American sector , thus precluding any immediate inquiry into its failure .	The German commander of the Normandy Sector — Günther von Kluge — was at the Canadian front on 25 July , instead of the American front where the eventual breakout occurred .	The Battle of Verrières Ridge had little overall effect on British attempts to break out of Caen , as significant resources were transferred to the American front in the aftermath of Cobra , to exploit Bradley 's success ; the ridge eventually fell to the general Allied advance .	- Verrières Ridge , a Canadian Sacrifice - Black Watch Regiment at Verrières Ridge , History Television - Canada at War , Operation Atlantic & Verrières Ridge	Verrieres Ridge Verrieres Ridge Verrieres Ridge Verrieres Ridge
