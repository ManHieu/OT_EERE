Text	At 3:00 a.m. , Townsend told Cloud he did not want large groups of blacks congregating in the mess hall , and likened the gathering to a " victory party . "	Townsend and Cloud dispersed the group and met with any sailors who were still upset in the forecastle until 5:00 a.m .	Many white sailors aboard the massive ship were unaware that the incident had occurred , and began to hear rumors when they awoke .	Becoming increasingly angry , about 150 white sailors began to arm themselves and congregated in a berthing compartment , readying themselves for what they thought would be an outright racial battle for control of _ Kitty Hawk _ .	Hearing of the discord , Cloud went to address the group , who dismissed him as being " nothing more than a nigger , like the rest of them . "
