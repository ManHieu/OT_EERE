Text	Over the following months and years , stories began circulating that employees of Eastern Air Lines , and numerous passengers , had reported sightings of the dead crew members , captain Robert Loft and second officer ( flight engineer ) Donald Repo , sitting on board other L- 1011s ( including , in particular , N318EA ) .	These stories speculated that parts of the crashed aircraft were salvaged after the investigation and refitted into other L - 1011s .	The reported hauntings were said to only be seen on the planes that used the spare parts .	Gossip regarding the sighting of the spirits of Don Repo and Bob Loft spread throughout Eastern Air Lines to the point where Eastern 's management warned employees that they could face dismissal if caught spreading ghost stories .	While Eastern Air Lines publicly denied their planes were haunted , they reportedly removed all the salvaged parts from their L - 1011 fleet .
