Text	Some commentators believe that the inept manner in which the political events were handled by the Soviet government was affected by the failing health of Andropov , who was permanently hospitalised in late September or early October 1983 ( Andropov died the following February ) .	In a 2015 interview Igor Kirillov , the senior Soviet news anchor , said that he was initially given a printed TASS report to announce over the news on September 1 , which included an " open and honest " admission that the plane was shot down by mistake ( a wrong judgement call by the Far Eastern Air Defence Command ) .	However , at the moment the opening credits of the _ Vremya _ evening news programme rolled in , an editor ran in and snatched the sheet of paper from his hand , handing him another TASS report which was " completely opposite " to the first one and to the truth .	[ Demonstrators near the White House protest the Soviet shootdown of KAL 007 ( September 2 , 1983 ) ]	The shootdown happened at a very tense time in U.S. â€“ Soviet relations during the Cold War .
