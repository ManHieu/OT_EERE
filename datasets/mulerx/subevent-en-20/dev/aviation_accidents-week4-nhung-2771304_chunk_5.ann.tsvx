Text	On 28 September 1987 Carlsson was interviewed in the _ World In Action _ TV documentary The Case of the Disappearing Diamonds when he warned that the UN would take action against those who were illegally exploiting Namibia 's natural resources .	A year later , he convened a meeting in Stockholm between the SWAPO leadership ( Sam Nujoma , Hage Geingob and Hidipo Hamutenya ) , and a delegation of whites from Namibia to discuss developments in the independence process .	Namibia 's independence had been expected to take place soon after United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 was agreed in September 1978 .	However , it took over 10 years for UNSCR 435 to be implemented .	The delay was blamed by author and journalist Christopher Hitchens on Chester Crocker 's ' procrastination ' and on President Ronald Reagan 's ' attempt to change the subject to the presence of Cuban forces in Angola ' as well as the ' flagrant bias ' in America 's Namibia policy in favour of apartheid South Africa .
