Text	The trial was scheduled to begin in September 2017 , but it was delayed because Bertoldi was serving a sentence in a French prison for kidnapping and could not be extradited .	Bertoldi admitted to having received diamonds stolen in the robbery , but denied any involvement .	In May 2018 , 18 of those tried in connection to the heist were acquitted .	The case against Bertoldi , the suspected mastermind , was yet to be heard , pending the outcome of his appeal over his kidnapping conviction .	In June 2019 , the correctional tribunal of Brussels sentenced Bertoldi to five years of imprisonment and a fine for being a co-conspirator in the heist , for being part of a criminal organisation and for money laundering .
