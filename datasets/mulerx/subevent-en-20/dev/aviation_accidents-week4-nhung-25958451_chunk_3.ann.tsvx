Text	The Anniston airport manager was notified by GP Express that the plane did not arrive and could not be reached approximately 11 minutes after the scheduled arrival time ; however , this information was not shared with local search and rescue authorities .	A search was not started until Sgt. Lachut directed rescuers toward the crash site around noon .	Rescuers arrived on foot about 2:15 p.m. and evacuated the remaining survivors by four - wheel - drive vehicle to Northeast Alabama Regional Medical Center in Anniston .	Heavy rains at the time made travel difficult , obscured visibility , and also quickly knocked down the post-accident fire , the smoke of which may have alerted authorities to the crash and approximate location more quickly .	The findings of the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) were released on March 2 , 1993 .
