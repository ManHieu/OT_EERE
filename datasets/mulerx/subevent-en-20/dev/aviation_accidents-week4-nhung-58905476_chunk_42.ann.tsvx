Text	On 25 October 2019 , after the release of the final investigation report by NTSC , Boeing President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg responded :	" We are addressing the KNKT 's safety recommendations , and taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 MAX to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again .	Safety is an enduring value for everyone at Boeing and the safety of the flying public , our customers , and the crews aboard our airplanes is always our top priority .	We value our long - standing partnership with Lion Air and we look forward to continuing to work together in the future . "	In January 2020 , newly released unredacted internal messages within Boeing employees reveal that they have mocked Lion Air with profanity , belittling the airline for requesting additional simulator training for their Boeing 737 MAX pilots in 2017 citing that Lion 's sister airline ( Malindo Air ) have already operated the type .
