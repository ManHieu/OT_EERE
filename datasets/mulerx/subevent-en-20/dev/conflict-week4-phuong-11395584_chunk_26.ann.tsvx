Text	They were allowed to return after 1856 .	During their period of exile , rivalry between the various factions became obvious , a conflict which became the basis for political allegiances in later years .	In the meantime , Magheru , upon the advice of Colquhoun , ordered the demobilization of his troops ( October 10 ) , and , accompanied by a few of his officers , passed the Southern Carpathians into Hermannstadt — at the time , the Transylvanian city was nominally in the Austrian Empire , but gripped by the Hungarian Revolution .	Starting in December 1848 , a number of Wallachian revolutionaries who had escaped or had been set free from arrest began mediating an understanding between Hungary 's Lajos Kossuth and those Romanian Transylvanian activists and peasants who , under the leadership of Avram Iancu , were mounting military resistance to the _ Honvédség _ troops of Józef Bem .	Nicolae Bălcescu emerged from his refuge in the Principality of Serbia , and , together with Alexandru G. Golescu and Ion Ionescu de la Brad , began talks with Iancu in Zlatna .
