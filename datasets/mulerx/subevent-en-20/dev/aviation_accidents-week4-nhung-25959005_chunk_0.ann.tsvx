Text	NORTHWEST ORIENT AIRLINES FLIGHT 705 was a scheduled passenger flight operated on February 12 , 1963 , that broke up in midair and crashed into the Florida Everglades shortly after takeoff from Miami International Airport in a severe thunderstorm .	The plane was destined for Portland , Oregon , via Chicago , Spokane , and Seattle .	Prior to departing from Miami in the early afternoon , the Northwest Orient flight crew questioned the ground controller at the airport about the departure routes being used , and the controller replied that most flights were departing " either through a southwest climb or a southeast climb and then back over the top of it . "	After the Boeing 720 lifted off from Runway 27L , helmed by captain Roy Almquist , it made a left turn , based on radar vectors from Miami Departure Control , to avoid areas of anticipated turbulence associated with thunderstorm activity .	Another flight had followed the same guidance shortly before the jet took off .
