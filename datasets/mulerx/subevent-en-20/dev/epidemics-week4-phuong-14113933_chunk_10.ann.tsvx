Text	Rumours of the disease spreading prompted traders to act quickly as a reduction in the indigenous population meant a reduction in profit from the furs they brought in .	A good information network , a supply of vaccines at posts , and a willingness among all for vaccination meant their efforts were much more successful than American responses .	Vaccination performed by Hudson Bay Company workers and trained Indigenous people were critical to limiting the spread of smallpox in Canada .	After the epidemic , the Hudson Bay Company implemented a territory wide vaccination program which further reduced smallpox deaths .	Unfortunately , as people entered communities to vaccinate against smallpox , they brought with them other diseases that kept mortality rates high .
