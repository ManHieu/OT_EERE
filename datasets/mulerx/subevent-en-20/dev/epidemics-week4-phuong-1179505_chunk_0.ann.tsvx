Text	WELL POISONING is the act of malicious manipulation of potable water resources in order to cause illness or death , or to deny an opponent access to fresh water resources .	Well poisoning has been historically documented as a strategy during wartime since antiquity , and was used both offensively ( as a terror tactic to disrupt and depopulate a target area ) and defensively ( as a scorched earth tactic to deny an invading army sources of clean water ) .	Rotting corpses ( both animal and human ) thrown down wells were the most common implementation ; in one of the earliest examples of biological warfare , corpses known to have died from common transmissible diseases of the Pre-Modern era such as bubonic plague or tuberculosis were especially favored for well - poisoning .	Additionally , well poisoning was one of the three gravest antisemitic accusations made against Jews during this period ( the other two being host desecration and blood libel ) .	Similar accusations were also made of Koreans living in Japan in the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake .
