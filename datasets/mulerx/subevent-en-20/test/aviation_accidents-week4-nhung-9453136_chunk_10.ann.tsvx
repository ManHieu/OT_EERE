Text	Captain Lehmann recounts his personal experiences as a zeppelin captain in war and peace in _	Auf Luft patrouille und Welt fahrt : Erlebnisse eines Zeppelin Fuhrers in Krieg und Frieden _.	Captain Lehmann 's last book , _ Zeppelin : The Story of Lighter - than - air Craft _ , was being translated by Leonhard Adelt , who was on board with Lehmann as a guest during the _ Hindenburg _{{'} } s last flight .	The book had recently been published in German when the _ Hindenburg _ was destroyed .	The English translation , completed by Jay Dratler , was published later in 1937 with a preface and closing chapter by the American airship captain Charles E. Rosendahl , who had interviewed Lehmann on his deathbed .
