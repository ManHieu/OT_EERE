Text	Father Joseph Cuyt , a local priest who had been observing the airplane as it came in to land , rushed to the scene but was driven back by the intense heat of the fire .	Airport rescue vehicles arrived at the crash site almost immediately but the plane was already a blazing fire .	Baudouin I , King of the Belgians , and his consort , Queen Fabiola , travelled to the scene of the disaster to provide comfort to the bereaved families .	They donated oak coffins bearing the royal seal to transport the bodies back home .	All eighteen members of the 1961 U.S. Figure Skating team lost their lives , as well as sixteen other people who were accompanying them , including family members , professional coaches , and skating officials .
