Text	The Canadian Official Historian Charles Stacey , and military historian Michael Reynolds , wrote that German casualty figures for individual operations are difficult to determine .	Stacey attributes this to the gradual degradation of the German logistics chain , leaving incomplete records , and Reynolds wrote that units sometimes over-reported their losses , in the hope of receiving more reinforcements .	German losses for the battle were significantly fewer than those suffered by the Canadians .	According to Reynolds , between 16 July and 1 August , the 1st SS Panzer Division lost 1,092 men killed , wounded or captured — along with 11 _ Panzer__IV tanks and 10 _ Sturmgeschütz__III self - propelled guns — in fighting across all its fronts including at Verrières .	Over a similar period , he estimates the 12th SS Panzer Division — in all sectors — suffered only 134 casualties .
