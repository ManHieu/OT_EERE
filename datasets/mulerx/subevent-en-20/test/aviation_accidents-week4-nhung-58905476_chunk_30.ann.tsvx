Text	Information later emerged that a third pilot was on the flight to Jakarta and told the crew to cut power to the stabilizer trim motors which fixed the problem .	This method is a standard memory item in the 737 checklist .	Subsequently , the National Transportation Safety Committee confirmed the presence of an off - duty Boeing 737 MAX 8 qualified pilot in the cockpit but did not confirm the role of the pilot in fixing the problem , and denied that there was any recording of the previous flight in the CVR of Lion Air Flight 610 .	The erratic nature of the flight path led Indonesian aviation expert Gerry Soejatman to speculate that the pitot tubes , used in the air speed indication system , may have played a role in the crash .	They have contributed to previous crashes .
