Text	Modern technologies have reduced the incidence of these failures considerably , both by design ( specially the elimination of plain bearings ) and intervention ( non-destructive testing in service ) .	If a vertical , lateral , or crosslevel irregularity is cyclic and takes place at a wavelength corresponding to the natural frequency of certain vehicles traversing the route section , there is a risk of resonant harmonic oscillation in the vehicles , leading to extreme improper movement and possibly derailment .	This is most hazardous when a cyclic roll is set up by crosslevel variations , but vertical cyclical errors also can result in vehicles lifting off the track ; this is especially the case when the vehicles are in the tare ( empty ) condition , and if the suspension is not designed to have appropriate characteristics .	The last condition applies if the suspension springing has a stiffness optimised for the loaded condition , or for a compromise loading condition , so that it is too stiff in the tare situation .	The vehicle wheelsets become momentarily unloaded vertically so that the guidance required from the flanges or wheel tread contact is inadequate .
