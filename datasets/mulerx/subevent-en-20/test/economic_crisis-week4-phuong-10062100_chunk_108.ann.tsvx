Text	Countering the analysis of Krugman and members of the FCIC , Peter Wallison argues that the crisis was caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble that was _ supported largely by low or no - down - payment loans _ , which was uniquely the case for U.S. _ residential _ housing loans .	He states : " It is not true that every bubble – even a large bubble – has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates . "	As an example , Wallison notes that other developed countries had " large bubbles during the 1997 – 2007 period " but " the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 1997 – 2007 [ bubble ] deflated . "	Other analysis calls into question the validity of comparing the residential loan crisis to the commercial loan crisis .	After researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis , Xudong An and Anthony B. Sanders reported ( in December 2010 ) : " We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS [ commercial mortgage - backed securities ] loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis . "
