Text	Unfortunately the bootlegger 's twin brother is the local sheriff , and he quickly arrests Addie and Moze .	Addie hides their money in her hat , steals back the key to their car , and the pair escape .	To elude pursuit , they trade their new car for a decrepit Model T farm truck after Moze beats a hillbilly , Leroy , in a " rasslin ' match " .	Moze and Addie make it across the state line to Missouri , where Moze sets up another swindle , only to be caught again by the sheriff and his deputies ; outside of their jurisdiction and unable to make an arrest , they beat Moze and rob him of his and Addie 's savings .	Humiliated and defeated , Moze drops Addie at the house of her aunt in St. Joseph , but a disappointed Addie rejoins him on the road .
