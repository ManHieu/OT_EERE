Text	It is customary for the Air Force to impound radar trackings involving possible litigation in cases of aviation accidents .	In the civil litigation for damages , the United States Department of Justice explained that the tapes from the Air Force radar installation at King Salmon , Alaska pertinent to KAL 007 's flight in the Bethel area had been destroyed and could therefore not be supplied to the plaintiffs .	At first Justice Department lawyer Jan Van Flatern stated that they were destroyed 15 days after the shootdown .	Later , he said he had " misspoken " and changed the time of destruction to 30 hours after the event .	A Pentagon spokesman concurred , saying that the tapes are re-cycled for reuse from 24 â€“ 30 hours afterwards ; the fate of KAL 007 was known inside this timeframe .
