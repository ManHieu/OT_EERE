Text	_ STAR TIGER _ ( registration G - AHNP ) was an Avro Tudor IV passenger aircraft owned and operated by British South American Airways ( BSAA ) which disappeared without a trace over the Atlantic Ocean while on a flight between Santa Maria in the Azores and Bermuda in the early morning of 30 January 1948 .	The loss of the aircraft along with that of BSAA Avro Tudor _ Star Ariel _ in 1949 remains unsolved , with the resulting speculation helping to develop the Bermuda Triangle legend .	British South American Airways ( BSAA ) was an airline created by former World War II pilots in an effort to provide service on the previously untapped South American trade and passenger routes .	Originally named British Latin American Air Lines ( BLAIR ) it was split off from the British Overseas Airways Corporation to operate its South Atlantic routes .	It commenced transatlantic services in March 1946 , with a BSAA Avro Lancastrian making the first operational flight from London 's Heathrow Airport .
