Text	In 2005 , Vivanco stated , " If the shareholders of this company belong to a government like Cuba where they have no basic concept of free speech and zero tolerance for independent views , God help us " .	Human Rights Watch also criticized the Venezuelan government in 2008 for preventing the freedom of expression of private media by blocking their expansion while strengthening the presence of Telesur and other government media in the country .	Following the election of Mauricio Macri as President of Argentina , Macri and Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro engaged in disputes over Venezuela 's human rights , with the Argentine government later pulling its funding of Telesur in March 2016 alleging that Telesur " blocks alternative viewpoints " .	A group of Telesur and Venezuelan state media journalists were in Honduras on 28 June 2009 to cover the events in relation to a non-binding referendum on the possibility of changes to the constitution of Honduras .	Upon learning that soldiers of the Honduran military had ousted President Manuel Zelaya in a coup and exiled him to Costa Rica , the Telesur staff stayed in the country to cover events following the coup .
