Text	The WALLACHIAN REVOLUTION OF 1848 was a Romanian liberal and nationalist uprising in the Principality of Wallachia .	Part of the Revolutions of 1848 , and closely connected with the unsuccessful revolt in the Principality of Moldavia , it sought to overturn the administration imposed by Imperial Russian authorities under the _ Regulamentul Organic _ regime , and , through many of its leaders , demanded the abolition of boyar privilege .	Led by a group of young intellectuals and officers in the Wallachian Militia , the movement succeeded in toppling the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu , whom it replaced with a Provisional Government and a Regency , and in passing a series of major progressive reforms , first announced in the Proclamation of Islaz .	Despite its rapid gains and popular backing , the new administration was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces , especially over the issue of land reform .	Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government , and its international status was always contested by Russia .
