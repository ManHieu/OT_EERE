Text	They found that if the propellers were reversed prior to take - off they would not , if the flag was not raised , be rotated automatically again in the air to produce forward thrust if full power was applied .	Tests performed by United Airlines showed that , if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines , then the aircraft would spiral into a dive .	If METO ( maximum except take - off ) power was applied to Nos. 1 , 2 and 3 engines , and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4 , then the aircraft would become uncontrollable .	If full left aileron was applied , the aircraft could be recovered for a short period of time , but a violent turn to the right would continue , and the competing forces would cause the aircraft to stall , and violently roll and pitch down .	Flight tests , investigators said , accurately reproduced what happened to _ Mainliner Idaho _ during the accident sequence .
