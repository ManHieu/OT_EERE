Text	Patches of thick fog were drifting across the airfield ; hence visibility was greatly reduced for pilots and the control tower .	The collision occurred when the KLM airliner initiated its take off run while the Pan Am airliner , shrouded in fog , was still on the runway and about to turn off onto the taxiway .	The impact and resulting fire killed everyone on board KLM 4805 and most of the occupants of Pan Am 1736 , with only 61 survivors in the front section of the aircraft .	The subsequent investigation by Spanish authorities concluded that the primary cause of the accident was the KLM captain 's decision to take off in the mistaken belief that a take off clearance from air traffic control ( ATC ) had been issued .	Dutch investigators placed a greater emphasis on a mutual misunderstanding in radio communications between the KLM crew and ATC , but ultimately KLM admitted that their crew was responsible for the accident and the airline agreed to financially compensate the relatives of all of the victims .
