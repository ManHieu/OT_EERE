Text	The full load of fuel , which had caused the earlier delay , ignited immediately into a fireball that could not be subdued for several hours .	One of the 61 survivors of the Pan Am flight said that sitting in the nose of the plane probably saved his life : " We all settled back , and the next thing an explosion took place and the whole port side , left side of the plane , was just torn wide open . "	Captain Veldhuyzen van Zanten was KLM 's chief of flight training and one of their most senior pilots .	About two months before the accident , he had conducted the Boeing 747 qualification check on the co-pilot of Flight 4805 .	His photograph was used for publicity materials such as magazine advertisements , including the inflight magazine on board PH - BUF .
