Text	In a comparative study of the two tragedies published in 1991 , political scientist Robert Entman points out that with KAL 007 , " the angle taken by the US media emphasised the moral bankruptcy and guilt of the perpetrating nation .	With Iran Air 655 , the frame de-emphasised guilt and focused on the complex problems of operating military high technology " .	Since the aircraft had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals had died in the incident , the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) was legally required to investigate .	On the morning of September 1 , the NTSB chief in Alaska , James Michelangelo , received an order from the NTSB in Washington at the behest of the State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington , and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation .	The U.S. State Department , after closing the NTSB investigation on the grounds that it was not an accident , pursued an ICAO investigation instead .
