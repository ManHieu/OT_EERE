Text	The Canadian Aviation Safety Board ( CASB ) determined that an uncontained failure of the left engine thirteenth stage compressor disc had occurred .	Debris from the engine punctured a fuel cell , resulting in the fire .	The disc failure was the result of fatigue cracking .	The fire was attributed to a faulty compressor disc that blew apart , rupturing the fuel tanks .	This incident was similar to the cause of the British Airtours Flight 28 M disaster that claimed 55 lives in 1985 .
